        <h3 class="title">The Repository for Germinal Choice</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_p01">During the 1970s, American millionaire Robert Klark Graham began one of the most controversial and unique sperm banks in the world. He called it the Repository for Germinal Choice. The sperm bank was part of a project that attempted to combat the “genetic decay” Graham saw all around him. He believed human reproduction was experiencing a genetic decline, making for a population of “retrograde humans,” and he was convinced that the way to save the human race was to breed the best genes of his generation (Plotz, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_001">Plotz, D. (2001, February 8). The “genius babies,” and how they grew. <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/100331">http://www.slate.com/id/100331</a></span></p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_p02">Graham began his project by collecting sperm samples from the most intelligent and highly achieving people he could find, including scientists, entrepreneurs, athletes, and even Nobel Prize winners. Then he advertised for potential mothers, who were required to be married to infertile men, educated, and financially well-off. Graham mailed out catalogs to the potential mothers, describing the donors using code names such as “Mr. Grey-White,” who was “ruggedly handsome, outgoing, and positive, a university professor, expert marksman who enjoys the classics,” and “Mr. Fuchsia,” who was an “Olympic gold medalist, tall, dark, handsome, bright, a successful businessman and author” (Plotz, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_002">Plotz, D. (2001, February 8). The “genius babies,” and how they grew. <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/100331">http://www.slate.com/id/100331</a></span> When the mother had made her choice, the sperm sample was delivered by courier and insemination was carried out at home. Before it closed following Graham’s death in 1999, the repository claimed responsibility for the birth of 228 children.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_p03">But did Graham’s project actually create superintelligent babies? Although it is difficult to be sure, because very few interviews with the offspring have been permitted, at least some of the repository’s progeny are indeed smart. Reporter for <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> magazine David Plotz (2001)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_003">Plotz, D. (2001, February 8). The “genius babies,” and how they grew. <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/100331">http://www.slate.com/id/100331</a></span> spoke to nine families who benefited from the repository, and they proudly touted their children’s achievements. He found that most of the offspring in the families interviewed seem to resemble their genetic fathers. Three from donor Mr. Fuchsia, the Olympic gold medalist, are reportedly gifted athletes. Several who excel in math and science were fathered by professors of math and science.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_p04">And the offspring, by and large, seem to be doing well, often attending excellent schools and maintaining very high grade-point averages. One of the offspring, now 26 years old, is particularly intelligent. In infancy, he could mark the beat of classical music with his hands. In kindergarten, he could read <em class="emphasis">Hamlet</em> and was learning algebra, and at age 6, his IQ was already 180. But he refused to apply to prestigious universities, such as Harvard or Yale, opting instead to study at a smaller progressive college and to major in comparative religion, with the aim of becoming an elementary school teacher. He is now an author of children’s books.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_p05">Although it is difficult to know for sure, it appears that at least some of the children of the repository are indeed outstanding. But can the talents, characteristics, and skills of this small repository sample be attributed to genetics alone? After all, consider the parents of these children: Plotz reported that the parents, particularly the mothers, were highly involved in their children’s development and took their parental roles very seriously. Most of the parents studied child care manuals, coached their children’s sports teams, practiced reading with their kids, and either home-schooled them or sent them to the best schools in their areas. And the families were financially well-off. Furthermore, the mothers approached the repository at a relatively older child-bearing age, when all other options were exhausted. These children were desperately wanted and very well loved. It is undeniable that, in addition to their genetic backgrounds, all this excellent nurturing played a significant role in the development of the repository children.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_p06">Although the existence of the repository provides interesting insight into the potential importance of genetics on child development, the results of Graham’s experiment are inconclusive. The offspring interviewed are definitely smart and talented, but only one of them was considered a true genius and child prodigy. And nurture may have played as much a role as nature in their outcomes (Olding, 2006; Plotz, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_004">Olding, P. (2006, June 15). The genius sperm bank.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_p08">Each of the stages of development has its unique physical, cognitive, and emotional changes that define the stage and that make each stage unique, one from the other.

As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch06_t01">Table 6.1 "Challenges of Development as Proposed by Erik Erikson"</a>, Erikson believed that each life stage has a unique challenge that the person who reaches it must face. And according to Erikson, successful development involves dealing with and resolving the goals and demands of each of the life stages in a positive way.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_p09">As we progress through this chapter, we will see that Robert Klark Graham was in part right—nature does play a substantial role in development (it has been found, for instance, that identical twins, who share all of their genetic code, usually begin sitting up and walking on the exact same days). But nurture is also important—we begin to be influenced by our environments even while still in the womb, and these influences remain with us throughout our development. Furthermore, we will see that we play an active role in shaping our own lives. Our own behavior influences how and what we learn, how people respond to us, and how we develop as individuals. As you read the chapter, you will no doubt get a broader view of how we each pass through our own lives. You will see how we learn and adapt to life’s changes, and this new knowledge may help you better understand and better guide your own personal life journey.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Conception</em> occurs when an egg from the mother is fertilized by a sperm from the father. In humans, the conception process begins with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ovulation</a><span class="glossdef">The process whereby an egg stored in the woman’s ovaries matures and is released into the fallopian tube.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">when an ovum, or egg (the largest cell in the human body), which has been stored in one of the mother’s two ovaries, matures and is released into the fallopian tube</em>. Ovulation occurs about halfway through the woman’s menstrual cycle and is aided by the release of a complex combination of hormones. In addition to helping the egg mature, the hormones also cause the lining of the uterus to grow thicker and more suitable for implantation of a fertilized egg.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_p02">If the woman has had sexual intercourse within 1 or 2 days of the egg’s maturation, one of the up to 500 million sperm deposited by the man’s ejaculation, which are traveling up the fallopian tube, may fertilize the egg. Although few of the sperm are able to make the long journey, some of the strongest swimmers succeed in meeting the egg. As the sperm reach the egg in the fallopian tube, they release enzymes that attack the outer jellylike protective coating of the egg, each trying to be the first to enter. As soon as one of the millions of sperm enters the egg’s coating, the egg immediately responds by both blocking out all other challengers and at the same time pulling in the single successful sperm.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Zygote</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s01_p01">Within several hours, half of the 23 chromosomes from the egg and half of the 23 chromosomes from the sperm fuse together, creating a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">zygote</a><span class="glossdef">The product of an egg and sperm that merge together during conception.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a fertilized ovum</em>. The zygote continues to travel down the fallopian tube to the uterus. Although the uterus is only about 4 inches away in the woman’s body, this is nevertheless a substantial journey for a microscopic organism, and fewer than half of zygotes survive beyond this earliest stage of life. If the zygote is still viable when it completes the journey, it will attach itself to the wall of the uterus, but if it is not, it will be flushed out in the woman’s menstrual flow. During this time, the cells in the zygote continue to divide: The original two cells become four, those four become eight, and so on, until there are thousands (and eventually trillions) of cells. Soon the cells begin to <em class="emphasis">differentiate</em>, each taking on a separate function. The earliest differentiation is between the cells on the inside of the zygote, which will begin to form the developing human being, and the cells on the outside, which will form the protective environment that will provide support for the new life throughout the pregnancy.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Embryo</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Once the zygote attaches to the wall of the uterus, it is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embryo</a><span class="glossdef">The status of a zygote once it is implanted in the uterine wall.</span></span>. During the embryonic phase, which will last for the next 6 weeks, the major internal and external organs are formed, each beginning at the microscopic level, with only a few cells. The changes in the embryo’s appearance will continue rapidly from this point until birth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s02_p02">While the inner layer of embryonic cells is busy forming the embryo itself, the outer layer is forming the surrounding protective environment that will help the embryo survive the pregnancy.

The filtering occurs through a thin membrane that separates the mother’s blood from the blood of the fetus, allowing them to share only the material that is able to pass through the filter.

All the major aspects of the growing organism have been formed in the embryonic phase, and now the fetus has approximately six months to go from weighing less than an ounce to weighing an average of 6 to 8 pounds. That’s quite a growth spurt.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s03_p02">The fetus begins to take on many of the characteristics of a human being, including moving (by the 3rd month the fetus is able to curl and open its fingers, form fists, and wiggle its toes), sleeping, as well as early forms of swallowing and breathing. The fetus begins to develop its senses, becoming able to distinguish tastes and respond to sounds. Research has found that the fetus even develops some initial preferences. A newborn prefers the mother’s voice to that of a stranger, the languages heard in the womb over other languages (DeCasper &amp; Fifer, 1980; Moon, Cooper, &amp; Fifer, 1993),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_006">DeCasper, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s04_p01">Prenatal development is a complicated process and may not always go as planned. About 45% of pregnancies result in a miscarriage, often without the mother ever being aware it has occurred (Moore &amp; Persaud, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_008">Moore, K., &amp; Persaud, T.

Teratogens include general environmental factors, such as air pollution and radiation, but also the cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs that the mother may use. Teratogens do not always harm the fetus, but they are more likely to do so when they occur in larger amounts, for longer time periods, and during the more sensitive phases, as when the fetus is growing most rapidly. The most vulnerable period for many of the fetal organs is very early in the pregnancy—before the mother even knows she is pregnant.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s04_p02">Harmful substances that the mother ingests may harm the child. Cigarette smoking, for example, reduces the blood oxygen for both the mother and child and can cause a fetus to be born severely underweight. Another serious threat is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)</a><span class="glossdef">The detrimental effect of large amounts of maternal alcohol consumption on fetal development.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a condition caused by maternal alcohol drinking that can lead to numerous detrimental developmental effects, including limb and facial abnormalities, genital anomalies, and mental retardation</em>.

A. (1994). Fetal alcohol syndrome: Implications for psychologists. <em class="emphasis">Clinical Psychology Review, 14</em>, 91–111.</span> Because there is no known safe level of alcohol consumption for a pregnant woman, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that “a pregnant woman should not drink alcohol” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_010">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2005). <em class="emphasis">Alcohol use and pregnancy</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s01_s04_p04">Mothers normally receive genetic and blood tests during the first months of pregnancy to determine the health of the embryo or fetus. They may undergo sonogram, ultrasound, amniocentesis, or other testing. The screenings detect potential birth defects, including neural tube defects, chromosomal abnormalities (such as Down syndrome), genetic diseases, and other potentially dangerous conditions. Early diagnosis of prenatal problems can allow medical treatment to improve the health of the fetus.</p>

                <li>Development begins at the moment of conception, when the sperm from the father merges with the egg from the mother.</li>
                <li>Within a span of 9 months, development progresses from a single cell into a zygote and then into an embryo and fetus.</li>
                <li>The fetus is connected to the mother through the umbilical cord and the placenta, which allow the fetus and mother to exchange nourishment and waste. The fetus is protected by the amniotic sac.</li>
                <li>The embryo and fetus are vulnerable and may be harmed by the presence of teratogens.</li>
                <li>Smoking, alcohol use, and drug use are all likely to be harmful to the developing embryo or fetus, and the mother should entirely refrain from these behaviors during pregnancy or if she expects to become pregnant.</li>
                <li>Environmental factors, especially homelessness and poverty, have a substantial negative effect on healthy child development.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_p01">If all has gone well, a baby is born sometime around the 38th week of pregnancy. The fetus is responsible, at least in part, for its own birth because chemicals released by the developing fetal brain trigger the muscles in the mother’s uterus to start the rhythmic contractions of childbirth. The contractions are initially spaced at about 15-minute intervals but come more rapidly with time. When the contractions reach an interval of 2 to 3 minutes, the mother is requested to assist in the labor and help push the baby out.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s01_p02">In addition to reflexes, newborns have preferences—they like sweet tasting foods at first, while becoming more open to salty items by 4 months of age (Beauchamp, Cowart, Menellia, &amp; Marsh, 1994; Blass &amp; Smith, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_013">Beauchamp, D.

An infant only 6 days old is significantly more likely to turn toward its own mother’s breast pad than to the breast pad of another baby’s mother (Porter, Makin, Davis, &amp; Christensen, 1992),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_014">Porter, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s01_p03">Although infants are born ready to engage in some activities, they also contribute to their own development through their own behaviors. The child’s knowledge and abilities increase as it babbles, talks, crawls, tastes, grasps, plays, and interacts with the objects in the environment (Gibson, Rosenzweig, &amp; Porter, 1988; Gibson &amp; Pick, 2000; Smith &amp; Thelen, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_016">Gibson, E.

Research has found that animals raised in environments with more novel objects and that engage in a variety of stimulating activities have more brain synapses and larger cerebral cortexes, and they perform better on a variety of learning tasks compared with animals raised in more impoverished environments (Juraska, Henderson, &amp; Müller, 1984).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_017">Juraska, J.

            <h3 class="title">Research Focus: Using the Habituation Technique to Study What Infants Know</h3>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s01_p04">It may seem to you that babies have little ability to view, hear, understand, or remember the world around them. Indeed, the famous psychologist William James presumed that the newborn experiences a “blooming, buzzing confusion” (James, 1890, p. 462).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_019">James, W. (1890). <em class="emphasis">The principles of psychology</em>. New York, NY: Dover.</span> And you may think that, even if babies do know more than James gave them credit for, it might not be possible to find out what they know. After all, infants can’t talk or respond to questions, so how would we ever find out? But over the past two decades, developmental psychologists have created new ways to determine what babies know, and they have found that they know much more than you, or William James, might have expected.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s01_p05">One way that we can learn about the cognitive development of babies is by measuring their behavior in response to the stimuli around them. For instance, some researchers have given babies the chance to control which shapes they get to see or which sounds they get to hear according to how hard they suck on a pacifier (Trehub &amp; Rabinovitch, 1972).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_020">Trehub, S., &amp; Rabinovitch, M. (1972). Auditory-linguistic sensitivity in early infancy. <em class="emphasis">Developmental Psychology, 6</em>(1), 74–77.</span> The sucking behavior is used as a measure of the infants’ interest in the stimuli—the sounds or images they suck hardest in response to are the ones we can assume they prefer.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s01_p06">Another approach to understanding cognitive development by observing the behavior of infants is through the use of the habituation technique. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Habituation</a><span class="glossdef">Decreased responsiveness toward a stimulus after it has been presented numerous times in succession.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the decreased responsiveness toward a stimulus after it has been presented numerous times in succession</em>. Organisms, including infants, tend to be more interested in things the first few times they experience them and become less interested in them with more frequent exposure. Developmental psychologists have used this general principle to help them understand what babies remember and understand.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s01_p07">In the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">habituation procedure</a><span class="glossdef">A procedure that uses the principles of habituation to allow researchers to infer the cognitive processes of newborns.</span></span>, a baby is placed in a high chair and presented with visual stimuli while a video camera records the infant’s eye and face movements. When the experiment begins, a stimulus (e.g., the face of an adult) appears in the baby’s field of view, and the amount of time the baby looks at the face is recorded by the camera. Then the stimulus is removed for a few seconds before it appears again and the gaze is again measured. Over time, the baby starts to habituate to the face, such that each presentation elicits less gazing at the stimulus. Then, a new stimulus (e.g., the face of a different adult or the same face looking in a different direction) is presented, and the researchers observe whether the gaze time significantly increases. You can see that, if the infant’s gaze time increases when a new stimulus is presented, this indicates that the baby can differentiate the two stimuli.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s01_p08">Although this procedure is very simple, it allows researchers to create variations that reveal a great deal about a newborn’s cognitive ability. The trick is simply to change the stimulus in controlled ways to see if the baby “notices the difference.” Research using the habituation procedure has found that babies can notice changes in colors, sounds, and even principles of numbers and physics. For instance, in one experiment reported by Karen Wynn (1995),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_021">Wynn, K. (1995). Infants possess a system of numerical knowledge. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 4</em>, 172–176.</span> 6-month-old babies were shown a presentation of a puppet that repeatedly jumped up and down either two or three times, resting for a couple of seconds between sequences (the length of time and the speed of the jumping were controlled). After the infants habituated to this display, the presentation was changed such that the puppet jumped a different number of times. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch06_s02_s01_f02">Figure 6.3 "Can Infants Do Math?"</a>, the infants’ gaze time increased when Wynn changed the presentation, suggesting that the infants could tell the difference between the number of jumps.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p01">Childhood is a time in which changes occur quickly. The child is growing physically, and cognitive abilities are also developing. During this time the child learns to actively manipulate and control the environment, and is first exposed to the requirements of society, particularly the need to control the bladder and bowels. According to Erik Erikson, the challenges that the child must attain in childhood relate to the development of <em class="emphasis">initiative</em>, <em class="emphasis">competence</em>, and <em class="emphasis">independence</em>. Children need to learn to explore the world, to become self-reliant, and to make their own way in the environment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p02">These skills do not come overnight. Neurological changes during childhood provide children the ability to do some things at certain ages, and yet make it impossible for them to do other things. This fact was made apparent through the groundbreaking work of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. During the 1920s, Piaget was administering intelligence tests to children in an attempt to determine the kinds of logical thinking that children were capable of. In the process of testing the children, Piaget became intrigued, not so much by the answers that the children got right, but more by the answers they got wrong. Piaget believed that the incorrect answers that the children gave were not mere shots in the dark but rather represented specific ways of thinking unique to the children’s developmental stage. Just as almost all babies learn to roll over before they learn to sit up by themselves, and learn to crawl before they learn to walk, Piaget believed that children gain their cognitive ability in a developmental order. These insights—that children at different ages think in fundamentally different ways—led to Piaget’s <em class="emphasis">stage model of cognitive development</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p03">Piaget argued that children do not just passively learn but also actively try to make sense of their worlds. He argued that, as they learn and mature, children develop <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">schemas</a><span class="glossdef">A pattern of knowledge in long-term memory that helps us organize information.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">patterns of knowledge in long-term memory—that help them remember, organize, and respond to information</em>. Furthermore, Piaget thought that when children experience new things, they attempt to reconcile the new knowledge with existing schemas. Piaget believed that the children use two distinct methods in doing so, methods that he called <em class="emphasis">assimilation</em> and <em class="emphasis">accommodation</em> (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch06_s02_s02_f02">Figure 6.5 "Assimilation and Accommodation"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p04">When children employ <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assimilation</a><span class="glossdef">The use of an already developed schema to understand new information.</span></span>, they <em class="emphasis">use already developed schemas to understand new information</em>. If children have learned a schema for horses, then they may call the striped animal they see at the zoo a horse rather than a zebra. In this case, children fit the existing schema to the new information and label the new information with the existing knowledge. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Accommodation</a><span class="glossdef">The change of an existing schema on the basis of new information.</span></span>, on the other hand, involves <em class="emphasis">learning new information, and thus changing the schema</em>. When a mother says, “No, honey, that’s a zebra, not a horse,” the child may adapt the schema to fit the new stimulus, learning that there are different types of four-legged animals, only one of which is a horse.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p05">Piaget’s most important contribution to understanding cognitive development, and the fundamental aspect of his theory, was the idea that development occurs in unique and distinct stages, with each stage occurring at a specific time, in a sequential manner, and in a way that allows the child to think about the world using new capacities. Piaget’s stages of cognitive development are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch06_s02_s02_t01">Table 6.3 "Piaget’s Stages of Cognitive Development"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p06">The first developmental stage for Piaget was the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sensorimotor stage</a><span class="glossdef">A stage of Piaget’s model of cognitive development, lasting from birth to age 2, in which the baby perceives the environment through the senses and motor skills.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the cognitive stage that begins at birth and lasts until around the age of 2. It is defined by the direct physical interactions that babies have with the objects around them</em>. During this stage, babies form their first schemas by using their primary senses—they stare at, listen to, reach for, hold, shake, and taste the things in their environments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p07">During the sensorimotor stage, babies’ use of their senses to perceive the world is so central to their understanding that whenever babies do not directly perceive objects, as far as they are concerned, the objects do not exist. Piaget found, for instance, that if he first interested babies in a toy and then covered the toy with a blanket, children who were younger than 6 months of age would act as if the toy had disappeared completely—they never tried to find it under the blanket but would nevertheless smile and reach for it when the blanket was removed. Piaget found that it was not until about 8 months that the children realized that the object was merely covered and not gone. Piaget used the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">object permanence</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to be aware of an object’s existence even when it is not visible.</span></span> to refer to <em class="emphasis">the child’s ability to know that an object exists even when the object cannot be perceived</em>.</p>

During this stage, <em class="emphasis">children begin to use language and to think more abstractly about objects, but their understanding is more intuitive and without much ability to deduce or reason</em>. The thinking is preoperational, meaning that the child lacks the ability to operate on or transform objects mentally. In one study that showed the extent of this inability, Judy DeLoache (1987)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_022">DeLoache, J. S. (1987). Rapid change in the symbolic functioning of very young children. <em class="emphasis">Science, 238</em>(4833), 1556–1556.</span> showed children a room within a small dollhouse. Inside the room, a small toy was visible behind a small couch. The researchers took the children to another lab room, which was an exact replica of the dollhouse room, but full-sized. When children who were 2.5 years old were asked to find the toy, they did not know where to look—they were simply unable to make the transition across the changes in room size. Three-year-old children, on the other hand, immediately looked for the toy behind the couch, demonstrating that they were improving their operational skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p09">The inability of young children to view transitions also leads them to be <em class="emphasis">egocentric</em>—unable to readily see and understand other people’s viewpoints. Developmental psychologists define the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">theory of mind</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to take another person’s viewpoint.</span></span> as <em class="emphasis">the ability to take another person’s viewpoint</em>, and the ability to do so increases rapidly during the preoperational stage. In one demonstration of the development of theory of mind, a researcher shows a child a video of another child (let’s call her Anna) putting a ball in a red box. Then Anna leaves the room, and the video shows that while she is gone, a researcher moves the ball from the red box into a blue box. As the video continues, Anna comes back into the room. The child is then asked to point to the box where Anna will probably look to find her ball. Children who are younger than 4 years of age typically are unable to understand that Anna does not know that the ball has been moved, and they predict that she will look for it in the blue box. After 4 years of age, however, children have developed a theory of mind—they realize that different people can have different viewpoints, and that (although she will be wrong) Anna will nevertheless think that the ball is still in the red box.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p10">After about 7 years of age, the child moves into the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete operational stage</a><span class="glossdef">A stage of Piaget’s cognitive development model, between ages 7 to 11 years, in which children begin to use concepts of time, space, and numbers more accurately, and are able to use deductive or reversible reasoning.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">marked by more frequent and more accurate use of transitions, operations, and abstract concepts, including those of time, space, and numbers</em>. An important milestone during the concrete operational stage is the development of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conservation</a><span class="glossdef">The understanding that changes in the form of an object do not necessarily mean changes in the quantity of the object.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the understanding that changes in the form of an object do not necessarily mean changes in the quantity of the object</em>. Children younger than 7 years generally think that a glass of milk that is tall holds more milk than a glass of milk that is shorter and wider, and they continue to believe this even when they see the same milk poured back and forth between the glasses. It appears that these children focus only on one dimension (in this case, the height of the glass) and ignore the other dimension (width). However, when children reach the concrete operational stage, their abilities to understand such transformations make them aware that, although the milk looks different in the different glasses, the amount must be the same.</p>

Children in the formal operational stage are better able to systematically test alternative ideas to determine their influences on outcomes. For instance, rather than haphazardly changing different aspects of a situation that allows no clear conclusions to be drawn, they systematically make changes in one thing at a time and observe what difference that particular change makes. They learn to use deductive reasoning, such as “if this, then that,” and they become capable of imagining situations that “might be,” rather than just those that actually exist.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p12">Piaget’s theories have made a substantial and lasting contribution to developmental psychology. His contributions include the idea that children are not merely passive receptacles of information but rather actively engage in acquiring new knowledge and making sense of the world around them. This general idea has generated many other theories of cognitive development, each designed to help us better understand the development of the child’s information-processing skills (Klahr &amp; McWinney, 1998; Shrager &amp; Siegler, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_023">Klahr, D., &amp; McWhinney, B. (1998). Information Processing. In D. Kuhn &amp; R. S. Siegler (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of child psychology: Cognition, perception, &amp; language</em> (5th ed., Vol. 2, pp. 631–678).

SCADS: A model of children’s strategy choices and strategy discoveries. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 9</em>, 405–422.</span> Furthermore, the extensive research that Piaget’s theory has stimulated has generally supported his beliefs about the order in which cognition develops. Piaget’s work has also been applied in many domains—for instance, many teachers make use of Piaget’s stages to develop educational approaches aimed at the level children are developmentally prepared for (Driscoll, 1994; Levin, Siegler, &amp; Druyan, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_024">Driscoll, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p13">Over the years, Piagetian ideas have been refined. For instance, it is now believed that object permanence develops gradually, rather than more immediately, as a true stage model would predict, and that it can sometimes develop much earlier than Piaget expected. Renée Baillargeon and her colleagues (Baillargeon, 2004; Wang, Baillargeon, &amp; Brueckner, 2004)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_025">Baillargeon, R. (2004). Infants’ physical world. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13</em>(3), 89–94; Wang, S. H., Baillargeon, R., &amp; Brueckner, L. (2004). Young infants’ reasoning about hidden objects: Evidence from violation-of-expectation tasks with test trials only. <em class="emphasis">Cognition, 93</em>, 167–198.</span> placed babies in a habituation setup, having them watch as an object was placed behind a screen, entirely hidden from view. The researchers then arranged for the object to reappear from behind another screen in a different place. Babies who saw this pattern of events looked longer at the display than did babies who witnessed the same object physically being moved between the screens. These data suggest that the babies were aware that the object still existed even though it was hidden behind the screen, and thus that they were displaying object permanence as early as 3 months of age, rather than the 8 months that Piaget predicted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p14">Another factor that might have surprised Piaget is the extent to which a child’s social surroundings influence learning. In some cases, children progress to new ways of thinking and retreat to old ones depending on the type of task they are performing, the circumstances they find themselves in, and the nature of the language used to instruct them (Courage &amp; Howe, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_026">Courage, M. L., &amp; Howe, M. L. (2002). From infant to child: The dynamics of cognitive change in the second year of life. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 128</em>(2), 250–276.</span> And children in different cultures show somewhat different patterns of cognitive development. Dasen (1972)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_027">Dasen, P. R. (1972). Cross-cultural Piagetian research: A summary. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 3</em>, 23–39.</span> found that children in non-Western cultures moved to the next developmental stage about a year later than did children from Western cultures, and that level of schooling also influenced cognitive development. In short, Piaget’s theory probably understated the contribution of environmental factors to social development.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s02_p15">More recent theories (Cole, 1996; Rogoff, 1990; Tomasello, 1999),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_028">Cole, M.

When the chimps woke up and looked in the mirror, they touched the dot on their faces, not the dot on the faces in the mirror. These actions suggest that the chimps understood that they were looking at themselves and not at other animals, and thus we can assume that they are able to realize that they exist as individuals.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p01">One of the most important behaviors a child must learn is how to be accepted by others—the development of close and meaningful social relationships. <em class="emphasis">The emotional bonds that we develop with those with whom we feel closest, and particularly the bonds that an infant develops with the mother or primary caregiver</em>, are referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attachment</a><span class="glossdef">The strong need of an infant to be close to the primary caregiver.</span></span> (Cassidy &amp; Shaver, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_038">Cassidy, J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p02">As late as the 1930s, psychologists believed that children who were raised in institutions such as orphanages, and who received good physical care and proper nourishment, would develop normally, even if they had little interaction with their caretakers. But studies by the developmental psychologist John Bowlby (1953)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_039">Bowlby, J. (1953). Some pathological processes set in train by early mother-child separation. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Mental Science, 99</em>, 265–272.</span> and others showed that these children did not develop normally—they were usually sickly, emotionally slow, and generally unmotivated. These observations helped make it clear that normal infant development requires successful attachment with a caretaker.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p03">In one classic study showing the importance of attachment, Wisconsin University psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow investigated the responses of young monkeys, separated from their biological mothers, to two surrogate mothers introduced to their cages. One—the wire mother—consisted of a round wooden head, a mesh of cold metal wires, and a bottle of milk from which the baby monkey could drink. The second mother was a foam-rubber form wrapped in a heated terry-cloth blanket. The Harlows found that, although the infant monkeys went to the wire mother for food, they overwhelmingly preferred and spent significantly more time with the warm terry-cloth mother that provided no food but did provide comfort (Harlow, 1958).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_040">Harlow, H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p04">The Harlows’ studies confirmed that babies have social as well as physical needs. Both monkeys and human babies need a <em class="emphasis">secure base</em> that allows them to feel safe. From this base, they can gain the confidence they need to venture out and explore their worlds. Erikson (<a class="xref" href="stangor-ch06#stangor-ch06_t01">Table 6.1 "Challenges of Development as Proposed by Erik Erikson"</a>) was in agreement on the importance of a secure base, arguing that the most important goal of infancy was the development of a basic sense of trust in one’s caregivers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p05">Developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth, a student of John Bowlby, was interested in studying the development of attachment in infants.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p06">On the basis of their behaviors, the children are categorized into one of four groups, where each group reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver. A child with a <em class="emphasis">secure</em> attachment style usually explores freely while the mother is present and engages with the stranger. The child may be upset when the mother departs but is also happy to see the mother return. A child with an <em class="emphasis">ambivalent</em> (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">insecure-resistant</em>) attachment style is wary about the situation in general, particularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the mother rather than exploring the toys. When the mother leaves, the child is extremely distressed and is ambivalent when she returns. The child may rush to the mother but then fail to cling to her when she picks up the child. A child with an <em class="emphasis">avoidant</em> (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">insecure-avoidant</em>) attachment style will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little emotion when the mother departs or returns. The child may run away from the mother when she approaches. The child will not explore very much, regardless of who is there, and the stranger will not be treated much differently from the mother.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p07">Finally, a child with a <em class="emphasis">disorganized</em> attachment style seems to have no consistent way of coping with the stress of the strange situation—the child may cry during the separation but avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the mother but then freeze or fall to the floor. Although some cultural differences in attachment styles have been found (Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, &amp; Morelli, 2000),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_042">Rothbaum, F., Weisz, J., Pott, M., Miyake, K., &amp; Morelli, G.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p08">You might wonder whether differences in attachment style are determined more by the child (nature) or more by the parents (nurture). Most developmental psychologists believe that socialization is primary, arguing that a child becomes securely attached when the mother is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner, but that the insecure styles occur when the mother is insensitive and responds inconsistently to the child’s needs. In a direct test of this idea, Dutch researcher Dymphna van den Boom (1994)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_043">van den Boom, D. C. (1994). The influence of temperament and mothering on attachment and exploration: An experimental manipulation of sensitive responsiveness among lower-class mothers with irritable infants. <em class="emphasis">Child Development, 65</em>(5), 1457–1476.</span> randomly assigned some babies’ mothers to a training session in which they learned to better respond to their children’s needs. The research found that these mothers’ babies were more likely to show a secure attachment style in comparison to the mothers in a control group that did not receive training.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p09">But the attachment behavior of the child is also likely influenced, at least in part, by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">temperament</a><span class="glossdef">The innate personality characteristics of an infant.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the innate personality characteristics of the infant</em>. Some children are warm, friendly, and responsive, whereas others tend to be more irritable, less manageable, and difficult to console. These differences may also play a role in attachment (Gillath, Shaver, Baek, &amp; Chun, 2008; Seifer, Schiller, Sameroff, Resnick, &amp; Riordan, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_044">Gillath, O., Shaver, P.

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p10">You might wonder whether the attachment style displayed by infants has much influence later in life.

In their research, 60 middle-class infants who had been tested in the strange situation at 1 year of age were recontacted 20 years later and interviewed using a measure of adult attachment. Waters and colleagues found that 72% of the infants received the same secure versus insecure attachment classification in early adulthood as they had received as infants. The adults who changed categorization (usually from secure to insecure) were primarily those who had experienced traumatic events, such as the death or divorce of parents, severe illnesses (contracted by the parents or the children themselves), or physical or sexual abuse by a family member.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s02_s03_s02_p12">In addition to finding that people generally display the same attachment style over time, longitudinal studies have also found that the attachment classification received in infancy (as assessed using the strange situation or other measures) predicts many childhood and adult behaviors. Securely attached infants have closer, more harmonious relationship with peers, are less anxious and aggressive, and are better able to understand others’ emotions than are those who were categorized as insecure as infants (Lucas-Thompson &amp; Clarke-Stewart, (2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_047">Lucas-Thompson, R., &amp; Clarke-Stewart, K.

When the sample is large enough and the time frame long enough, the potential findings of such a study can provide rich and important information about how people change over time and the causes of those changes. The drawbacks of longitudinal studies include the cost and the difficulty of finding a large sample that can be tracked accurately over time and the time (many years) that it takes to get the data. In addition, because the results are delayed over an extended period, the research questions posed at the beginning of the study may become less relevant over time as the research continues.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Adolescence</em> is defined as the years between the onset of puberty and the beginning of adulthood. In the past, when people were likely to marry in their early 20s or younger, this period might have lasted only 10 years or less—starting roughly between ages 12 and 13 and ending by age 20, at which time the child got a job or went to work on the family farm, married, and started his or her own family. Today, children mature more slowly, move away from home at later ages, and maintain ties with their parents longer. For instance, children may go away to college but still receive financial support from parents, and they may come home on weekends or even to live for extended time periods. Thus the period between puberty and adulthood may well last into the late 20s, merging into adulthood itself. In fact, it is appropriate now to consider the period of adolescence and that of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emerging adulthood</a><span class="glossdef">The ages between 18 years and the middle or late 20s when the adolescent is first becoming an adult.</span></span> (<em class="emphasis">the ages between 18 and the middle or late 20s</em>) together.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_p02">During adolescence, the child continues to grow physically, cognitively, and emotionally, changing from a child into an adult. The body grows rapidly in size and the sexual and reproductive organs become fully functional. At the same time, as adolescents develop more advanced patterns of reasoning and a stronger sense of self, they seek to forge their own identities, developing important attachments with people other than their parents. Particularly in Western societies, where the need to forge a new independence is critical (Baumeister &amp; Tice, 1986; Twenge, 2006),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_051">Baumeister, R.

(2006). <em class="emphasis">Generation me: Why today’s young Americans are more confident, assertive, entitled—and more miserable than ever before</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span> this period can be stressful for many children, as it involves new emotions, the need to develop new social relationships, and an increasing sense of responsibility and independence.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_p03">Although adolescence can be a time of stress for many teenagers, most of them weather the trials and tribulations successfully. For example, the majority of adolescents experiment with alcohol sometime before high school graduation. Although many will have been drunk at least once, relatively few teenagers will develop long-lasting drinking problems or permit alcohol to adversely affect their school or personal relationships. Similarly, a great many teenagers break the law during adolescence, but very few young people develop criminal careers (Farrington, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_052">Farrington, D. P. (1995). The challenge of teenage antisocial behavior. In M. Rutter &amp; M. E. Rutter (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Psychosocial disturbances in young people: Challenges for prevention</em> (pp. 83–130). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</span> These facts do not, however, mean that using drugs or alcohol is a good idea. The use of recreational drugs can have substantial negative consequences, and the likelihood of these problems (including dependence, addiction, and even brain damage) is significantly greater for young adults who begin using drugs at an early age.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s01_p01">Adolescence begins with the onset of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">puberty</a><span class="glossdef">A developmental stage in adolescence in which hormonal changes create rapid physical changes in the body.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a developmental period in which hormonal changes cause rapid physical alterations in the body, culminating in sexual maturity</em>.

New York, NY: Plenum Press.</span> Boys typically begin to grow facial hair between ages 14 and 16, and both boys and girls experience a rapid growth spurt during this stage.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s01_p03">A major milestone in puberty for girls is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">menarche</a><span class="glossdef">The first menstrual period.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the first menstrual period</em>, typically experienced at around 12 or 13 years of age (Anderson, Dannal, &amp; Must, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_055">Anderson, S.

Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: Results from two nationally representative surveys of U.S. girls studied 25 years apart. <em class="emphasis">Pediatrics, 111</em>, 844–850.</span> The age of menarche varies substantially and is determined by genetics, as well as by diet and lifestyle, since a certain amount of body fat is needed to attain menarche. Girls who are very slim, who engage in strenuous athletic activities, or who are malnourished may begin to menstruate later. Even after menstruation begins, girls whose level of body fat drops below the critical level may stop having their periods. The sequence of events for puberty is more predictable than the age at which they occur. Some girls may begin to grow pubic hair at age 10 but not attain menarche until age 15. In boys, facial hair may not appear until 10 years after the initial onset of puberty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s01_p04">The timing of puberty in both boys and girls can have significant psychological consequences. Boys who mature earlier attain some social advantages because they are taller and stronger and, therefore, often more popular (Lynne, Graber, Nichols, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Botvin, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_056">Lynne, S.

Girls who mature early may find their maturity stressful, particularly if they experience teasing or sexual harassment (Mendle, Turkheimer, &amp; Emery, 2007; Pescovitz &amp; Walvoord, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_057">Mendle, J., Turkheimer, E., &amp; Emery, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s02_p01">Although the most rapid cognitive changes occur during childhood, the brain continues to develop throughout adolescence, and even into the 20s (Weinberger, Elvevåg, &amp; Giedd, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_059">Weinberger, D.

Development of the social brain during adolescence. <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 61</em>, 40–49.</span> As teenagers mature, the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for reasoning, planning, and problem solving, also continues to develop (Goldberg, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_061">Goldberg, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s02_p02">Adolescents often seem to act impulsively, rather than thoughtfully, and this may be in part because the development of the prefrontal cortex is, in general, slower than the development of the emotional parts of the brain, including the limbic system (Blakemore, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_063">Blakemore, S. J. (2008). Development of the social brain during adolescence. <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 61</em>, 40–49.</span> Furthermore, the hormonal surge that is associated with puberty, which primarily influences emotional responses, may create strong emotions and lead to impulsive behavior. It has been hypothesized that adolescents may engage in risky behavior, such as smoking, drug use, dangerous driving, and unprotected sex in part because they have not yet fully acquired the mental ability to curb impulsive behavior or to make entirely rational judgments (Steinberg, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_064">Steinberg, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s02_p03">The new cognitive abilities that are attained during adolescence may also give rise to new feelings of egocentrism, in which adolescents believe that they can do anything and that they know better than anyone else, including their parents (Elkind, 1978, p. 199).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_065">Elkind, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s03_p01">Some of the most important changes that occur during adolescence involve the further development of the self-concept and the development of new attachments. Whereas young children are most strongly attached to their parents, the important attachments of adolescents move increasingly away from parents and increasingly toward peers (Harris, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_068">Harris, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s03_p02">According to Erikson (<a class="xref" href="stangor-ch06#stangor-ch06_t01">Table 6.1 "Challenges of Development as Proposed by Erik Erikson"</a>), the main social task of the adolescent is the search for a unique identity—the ability to answer the question, “Who am I?” In the search for identity, the adolescent may experience role confusion in which he or she is balancing or choosing among identities, taking on negative or undesirable identities, or temporarily giving up looking for an identity altogether if things are not going well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s03_p03">One approach to assessing identity development was proposed by James Marcia (1980).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_069">Marcia, J.

Identity in adolescence. <em class="emphasis">Handbook of Adolescent Psychology, 5</em>, 145–160.</span> In his approach, adolescents are asked questions regarding their exploration of and commitment to issues related to occupation, politics, religion, and sexual behavior. The responses to the questions allow the researchers to classify the adolescent into one of four identity categories (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch06_s03_s03_t01">Table 6.4 "James Marcia’s Stages of Identity Development"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s03_p04">Studies assessing how teens pass through Marcia’s stages show that, although most teens eventually succeed in developing a stable identity, the path to it is not always easy and there are many routes that can be taken. Some teens may simply adopt the beliefs of their parents or the first role that is offered to them, perhaps at the expense of searching for other, more promising possibilities (foreclosure status). Other teens may spend years trying on different possible identities (moratorium status) before finally choosing one.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s03_p05">To help them work through the process of developing an identity, teenagers may well try out different identities in different social situations. They may maintain one identity at home and a different type of persona when they are with their peers. Eventually, most teenagers do integrate the different possibilities into a single self-concept and a comfortable sense of identity (identity-achievement status).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s03_p06">For teenagers, the peer group provides valuable information about the self-concept.

The friendship groups (cliques, crowds, or gangs) that are such an important part of the adolescent experience allow the young adult to try out different identities, and these groups provide a sense of belonging and acceptance (Rubin, Bukowski, &amp; Parker, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_071">Rubin, K.

                        <td valign="top">By early adolescence, the child begins to care about how situational outcomes impact others and wants to please and be accepted. At this developmental phase, people are able to value the good that can be derived from holding to social norms in the form of laws or less formalized rules. For example, a person at this level may say, “He should not steal the drug, as everyone will see him as a thief, and his wife, who needs the drug, wouldn’t want to be cured because of thievery,” or, “No matter what, he should obey the law because stealing is a crime.”</td>

                        <td valign="top">At this stage, individuals employ abstract reasoning to justify behaviors. Moral behavior is based on self-chosen ethical principles that are generally comprehensive and universal, such as justice, dignity, and equality. Someone with self-chosen principles may say, “The man should steal the drug to cure his wife and then tell the authorities that he has done so. He may have to pay a penalty, but at least he has saved a human life.”</td>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s04_p04">Although research has supported Kohlberg’s idea that moral reasoning changes from an early emphasis on punishment and social rules and regulations to an emphasis on more general ethical principles, as with Piaget’s approach, Kohlberg’s stage model is probably too simple. For one, children may use higher levels of reasoning for some types of problems, but revert to lower levels in situations where doing so is more consistent with their goals or beliefs (Rest, 1979).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_074">Rest, J. (1979). <em class="emphasis">Development in judging moral issues</em>. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.</span> Second, it has been argued that the stage model is particularly appropriate for Western, rather than non-Western, samples in which allegiance to social norms (such as respect for authority) may be particularly important (Haidt, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_075">Haidt, J. (2001). The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 108</em>(4), 814–834.</span> And there is frequently little correlation between how children score on the moral stages and how they behave in real life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s03_s04_p05">Perhaps the most important critique of Kohlberg’s theory is that it may describe the moral development of boys better than it describes that of girls. Carol Gilligan (1982)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_076">Gilligan, C. (1982). <em class="emphasis">In a different voice: Psychological theory and women’s development</em>. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</span> has argued that, because of differences in their socialization, males tend to value principles of justice and rights, whereas females value caring for and helping others. Although there is little evidence that boys and girls score differently on Kohlberg’s stages of moral development (Turiel, 1998),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_077">Turiel, E. (1998).

                <li>Adolescence is the period of time between the onset of puberty and emerging adulthood.</li>
                <li>Emerging adulthood is the period from age 18 years until the mid-20s in which young people begin to form bonds outside the family, attend college, and find work. Even so, they tend not to be fully independent and have not taken on all the responsibilities of adulthood. This stage is most prevalent in Western cultures.</li>
                <li>Puberty is a developmental period in which hormonal changes cause rapid physical alterations in the body.</li>
                <li>The cerebral cortex continues to develop during adolescence and early adulthood, enabling improved reasoning, judgment, impulse control, and long-term planning.</li>
                <li>A defining aspect of adolescence is the development of a consistent and committed self-identity. The process of developing an identity can take time but most adolescents succeed in developing a stable identity.</li>
                <li>Kohlberg’s theory proposes that moral reasoning is divided into the following stages: preconventional morality, conventional morality, and postconventional morality.</li>
                <li>Kohlberg’s theory of morality has been expanded and challenged, particularly by Gilligan, who has focused on differences in morality between boys and girls.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p01">Until the 1970s, psychologists tended to treat adulthood as a single developmental stage, with few or no distinctions made among the various periods that we pass through between adolescence and death. Present-day psychologists realize, however, that physical, cognitive, and emotional responses continue to develop throughout life, with corresponding changes in our social needs and desires. Thus the three stages of <em class="emphasis">early adulthood</em>, <em class="emphasis">middle adulthood</em>, and <em class="emphasis">late adulthood</em> each has its own physical, cognitive, and social challenges.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p02">In this section, we will consider the development of our cognitive and physical aspects that occur during <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">early adulthood</a><span class="glossdef">The ages between 25 and 45.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">middle adulthood</a><span class="glossdef">The ages between 45 and 65.</span></span>—roughly <em class="emphasis">the ages between 25 and 45 and between 45 and 65, respectively</em>. These stages represent a long period of time—longer, in fact, than any of the other developmental stages—and the bulk of our lives is spent in them. These are also the periods in which most of us make our most substantial contributions to society, by meeting two of Erik Erikson’s life challenges: We learn to give and receive love in a close, long-term relationship, and we develop an interest in guiding the development of the next generation, often by becoming parents.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Psychology in Everyday Life: What Makes a Good Parent?</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p03">One thing that you may have wondered about as you grew up, and which you may start to think about again if you decide to have children yourself, concerns the skills involved in parenting. Some parents are strict, others are lax; some parents spend a lot of time with their kids, trying to resolve their problems and helping to keep them out of dangerous situations, whereas others leave their children with nannies or in day care. Some parents hug and kiss their kids and say that they love them over and over every day, whereas others never do. Do these behaviors matter? And what makes a “good parent”?</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p04">We have already considered two answers to this question, in the form of what all children require: (1) babies need a conscientious mother who does not smoke, drink, or use drugs during her pregnancy, and (2) infants need caretakers who are consistently available, loving, and supportive to help them form a secure base. One case in which these basic goals are less likely to be met is when the mother is an adolescent. Adolescent mothers are more likely to use drugs and alcohol during their pregnancies, to have poor parenting skills in general, and to provide insufficient support for the child (Ekéus, Christensson, &amp; Hjern, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_079">Ekéus, C., Christensson, K., &amp; Hjern, A. (2004). Unintentional and violent injuries among pre-school children of teenage mothers in Sweden: A national cohort study. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 58</em>(8), 680–685.</span> As a result, the babies of adolescent mothers have higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, and incarceration in comparison to children of older mothers (Moore &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_080">Moore, M. R., &amp; Brooks-Gunn, J. (2002). Adolescent parenthood. In M. H. Bornstein (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of parenting: Being and becoming a parent</em> (2nd ed., Vol. 3, pp. 173–214). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p05">Normally, it is the mother who provides early attachment, but fathers are not irrelevant. In fact, studies have found that children whose fathers are more involved tend to be more cognitively and socially competent, more empathic, and psychologically better adjusted, compared with children whose fathers are less involved (Rohner &amp; Veneziano, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_081">Rohner, R. P., &amp; Veneziano, R. A. (2001). The importance of father love: History and contemporary evidence. <em class="emphasis">Review of General Psychology, 5</em>(4), 382–405.</span> In fact, Amato (1994)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_082">Amato, P. R. (1994). Father-child relations, mother-child relations, and offspring psychological well-being in adulthood. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marriage and the Family, 56</em>, 1031–1042.</span> found that, in some cases, the role of the father can be as or even more important than that of the mother in the child’s overall psychological health and well-being. Amato concluded, “Regardless of the quality of the mother-child relationship, the closer adult offspring were to their fathers, the happier, more satisfied, and less distressed they reported being” (p. 1039).</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p06">As the child grows, parents take on one of four types of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parenting styles</a><span class="glossdef">Parental behaviors that determine the nature of parent-child interactions.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">parental behaviors that determine the nature of parent-child interactions</em> and that guide their interaction with the child. These styles depend on whether the parent is more or less <em class="emphasis">demanding</em> and more or less <em class="emphasis">responsive</em> to the child (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch06_s04_f01">Figure 6.11 "Parenting Styles"</a>). <em class="emphasis">Authoritarian parents</em> are demanding but not responsive. They impose rules and expect obedience, tending to give orders (“Eat your food!”) and enforcing their commands with rewards and punishment, without providing any explanation of where the rules came from, except “Because I said so!” <em class="emphasis">Permissive parents</em>, on the other hand, tend to make few demands and give little punishment, but they are responsive in the sense that they generally allow their children to make their own rules. <em class="emphasis">Authoritative parents</em> are demanding (“You must be home by curfew”), but they are also responsive to the needs and opinions of the child (“Let’s discuss what an appropriate curfew might be”). They set rules and enforce them, but they also explain and discuss the reasons behind the rules. Finally, <em class="emphasis">rejecting-neglecting parents</em> are undemanding and unresponsive overall.</p>

            <p class="para">Parenting styles can be divided into four types, based on the combination of demandingness and responsiveness. The authoritative style, characterized by both responsiveness and also demandingness, is the most effective.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p07">Many studies of children and their parents, using different methods, measures, and samples, have reached the same conclusion—namely, that authoritative parenting, in comparison to the other three styles, is associated with a wide range of psychological and social advantages for children. Parents who use the authoritative style, with its combination of demands on the children as well as responsiveness to the children’s needs, have kids who have better psychological adjustment, school performance, and psychosocial maturity, compared with parents who use the other styles (Baumrind, 1996; Grolnick &amp; Ryan, 1989).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_083">Baumrind, D. (1996). The discipline controversy revisited. <em class="emphasis">Family Relations, 45</em>(4), 405–414; Grolnick, W. S., &amp; Ryan, R. M. (1989). Parent styles associated with children’s self-regulation and competence in school. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Educational Psychology, 81</em>(2), 143–154.</span> On the other hand, there are at least some cultural differences in the effectiveness of different parenting styles. Although the reasons for the differences are not completely understood, strict authoritarian parenting styles seem to work better in African American families than in European American families (Tamis-LeMonda, Briggs, McClowry, &amp; Snow, 2008),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_084">Tamis-LeMonda, C.

Challenges to the study of African American parenting: Conceptualization, sampling, research approaches, measurement, and design. <em class="emphasis">Parenting: Science and Practice, 8</em>(4), 319–358.</span> and better in Chinese families than in American families (Chang, Lansford, Schwartz, &amp; Farver, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_085">Chang, L., Lansford, J.

Marital quality, maternal depressed affect, harsh parenting, and child externalising in Hong Kong Chinese families. <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Behavioral Development, 28</em>(4), 311–318.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p08">Despite the fact that different parenting styles are differentially effective overall, every child is different and parents must be adaptable. Some children have particularly difficult temperaments, and these children require more parenting. Because these difficult children demand more parenting, the behaviors of the parents matter more for the children’s development than they do for other, less demanding children who require less parenting overall (Pleuss &amp; Belsky, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_086">Pluess, M., &amp; Belsky, J. (2010). Differential susceptibility to parenting and quality child care. <em class="emphasis">Developmental Psychology, 46</em>(2), 379–390.</span> These findings remind us how the behavior of the child can influence the behavior of the people in his or her environment.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch06_s04_p09">Although the focus is on the child, the parents must never forget about each other. Parenting is time consuming and emotionally taxing, and the parents must work together to create a relationship in which both mother and father contribute to the household tasks and support each other. It is also important for the parents to invest time in their own intimacy, as happy parents are more likely to stay together, and divorce has a profoundly negative impact on children, particularly during and immediately after the divorce (Burt, Barnes, McGue, &amp; Iaconon, 2008; Ge, Natsuaki, &amp; Conger, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_087">Burt, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s01_p01">Compared with the other stages, the physical and cognitive changes that occur in the stages of early and middle adulthood are less dramatic. As individuals pass into their 30s and 40s, their recovery from muscular strain becomes more prolonged, and their sensory abilities may become somewhat diminished, at least when compared with their prime years, during the teens and early 20s (Panno, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_088">Panno, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s02_p01">The stages of both early and middle adulthood bring about a gradual decline in fertility, particularly for women. Eventually, women experience <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">menopause</a><span class="glossdef">The cessation of the menstrual cycle, which usually occurs at around age 50.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the cessation of the menstrual cycle</em>, which usually occurs at around age 50. Menopause occurs because of the gradual decrease in the production of the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which slows the production and release of eggs into the uterus. Women whose menstrual cycles have stopped for 12 consecutive months are considered to have entered menopause (Minkin &amp; Wright, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_091">Minkin, M. J., &amp; Wright, C. V. (2004). <em class="emphasis">A woman’s guide to menopause and perimenopause</em>. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s02_p02">Researchers have found that women’s responses to menopause are both social as well as physical, and that they vary substantially across both individuals and cultures. Within individuals, some women may react more negatively to menopause, worrying that they have lost their femininity and that their final chance to bear children is over, whereas other women may regard menopause more positively, focusing on the new freedom from menstrual discomfort and unwanted pregnancy. In Western cultures such as in the United States, women are likely to see menopause as a challenging and potentially negative event, whereas in India, where older women enjoy more social privileges than do younger ones, menopause is more positively regarded (Avis &amp; Crawford, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_092">Avis, N.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s02_p03">Menopause may have evolutionary benefits. Infants have better chances of survival when their mothers are younger and have more energy to care for them, and the presence of older women who do not have children of their own to care for (but who can help out with raising grandchildren) can be beneficial to the family group. Also consistent with the idea of an evolutionary benefit of menopause is that the decline in fertility occurs primarily for women, who do most of the child care and who need the energy of youth to accomplish it. If older women were able to have children they might not be as able to effectively care for them. Most men never completely lose their fertility, but they do experience a gradual decrease in testosterone levels, sperm count, and speed of erection and ejaculation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s03_p01">Perhaps the major marker of adulthood is the ability to create an effective and independent life. Whereas children and adolescents are generally supported by parents, adults must make their own living and must start their own families. Furthermore, the needs of adults are different from those of younger persons.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s03_p02">Although the timing of the major life events that occur in early and middle adulthood vary substantially across individuals, they nevertheless tend to follow a general sequence, known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social clock</a><span class="glossdef">The culturally preferred “right time” for major life events, such as moving out of the house, getting married, and having children.</span></span>. The social clock refers to <em class="emphasis">the culturally preferred “right time” for major life events, such as moving out of the childhood house, getting married, and having children</em>. People who do not appear to be following the social clock (e.g., young adults who still live with their parents, individuals who never marry, and couples who choose not to have children) may be seen as unusual or deviant, and they may be stigmatized by others (DePaulo, 2006; Rook, Catalano, &amp; Dooley, 1989).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_093">DePaulo, B.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s03_p03">Although they are doing it later, on average, than they did even 20 or 30 years ago, most people do eventually marry. Marriage is beneficial to the partners, both in terms of mental health and physical health. People who are married report greater life satisfaction than those who are not married and also suffer fewer health problems (Gallagher &amp; Waite, 2001; Liu &amp; Umberson, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_094">Gallagher, M., &amp; Waite, L.

Statistical abstract of the United States 2006 (p. 218). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.</span> although about three quarters of people who divorce will remarry. Most divorces occur for couples in their 20s, because younger people are frequently not mature enough to make good marriage choices or to make marriages last. Marriages are more successful for older adults and for those with more education (Goodwin, Mosher, &amp; Chandra, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_096">Goodwin, P. Y., Mosher, W.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s04_s03_p05">Parenthood also involves a major and long-lasting commitment, and one that can cause substantial stress on the parents.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s01_p01">The changes associated with aging do not affect everyone in the same way, and they do not necessarily interfere with a healthy life. Former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr celebrated his 70th birthday in 2010 by playing at Radio City Music Hall, and Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger (who once supposedly said, “I’d rather be dead than singing ‘Satisfaction’ at 45”) continues to perform as he pushes 70. The golfer Tom Watson almost won the 2010 British Open golf tournament at the age of 59, playing against competitors in their 20s and 30s.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s01_p02">Researchers are beginning to better understand the factors that allow some people to age better than others. For one, research has found that the people who are best able to adjust well to changing situations early in life are also able to better adjust later in life (Rubin, 2007; Sroufe, Collins, Egeland, &amp; Carlson, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_102">Rubin, L.

Furthermore, this difference was explained by beliefs about aging—in both cultures, the older adults who believed that memory declined with age also showed more actual memory declines than did the older adults who believed that memory did not decline with age. In addition, more older Americans than older Chinese believed that memory declined with age, and as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch06_s05_s01_f02">Figure 6.13</a>, older Americans performed more poorly on the memory tasks.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s01_p04">Whereas it was once believed that almost all older adults suffered from a generalized memory loss, research now indicates that healthy older adults actually experience only some particular types of memory deficits, while other types of memory remain relatively intact or may even improve with age. Older adults do seem to process information more slowly—it may take them longer to evaluate information and to understand language, and it takes them longer, on average, than it does younger people, to recall a word that they know, even though they are perfectly able to recognize the word once they see it (Burke, Shafto, Craik, &amp; Salthouse, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_106">Burke, D.

New York, NY: Psychology Press.</span> Older adults also have more difficulty inhibiting and controlling their attention (Persad, Abeles, Zacks, &amp; Denburg, 2002),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_107">Persad, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s01_p05">But slower processing and less accurate executive control does not always mean worse memory, or even worse intelligence. Perhaps the elderly are slower in part because they simply have more knowledge. Indeed, older adults have more <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crystallized intelligence</a><span class="glossdef">A person’s accumulated general knowledge about the world, including semantic knowledge, vocabulary, and language.</span></span>—that is, <em class="emphasis">general knowledge about the world, as reflected in semantic knowledge, vocabulary, and language</em>. As a result, adults generally outperform younger people on measures of history, geography, and even on crossword puzzles, where this information is useful (Salthouse, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_109">Salthouse, T. A. (2004). What and when of cognitive aging. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13</em>(4), 140–144.</span> It is this superior knowledge combined with a slower and more complete processing style, along with a more sophisticated understanding of the workings of the world around them, that gives the elderly the advantage of “wisdom” over the advantages of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fluid intelligence</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to think and acquire information quickly and abstractly.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the ability to think and acquire information quickly and abstractly</em>—which favor the young (Baltes, Staudinger, &amp; Lindenberger, 1999; Scheibe, Kunzmann, &amp; Baltes, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_110">Baltes, P.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s01_p06">The differential changes in crystallized versus fluid intelligence help explain why the elderly do not necessarily show poorer performance on tasks that also require experience (i.e., crystallized intelligence), although they show poorer memory overall. A young chess player may think more quickly, for instance, but a more experienced chess player has more knowledge to draw on. Older adults are also more effective at understanding the nuances of social interactions than younger adults are, in part because they have more experience in relationships (Blanchard-Fields, Mienaltowski, &amp; Seay, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_111">Blanchard-Fields, F., Mienaltowski, A., &amp; Seay, R.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Changes During Aging: Retiring Effectively</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s03_p01">Because of increased life expectancy in the 21st century, elderly people can expect to spend approximately a quarter of their lives in retirement. Leaving one’s career is a major life change and can be a time when people experience anxiety, depression, and other negative changes in the self-concept and in self-identity. On the other hand, retirement may also serve as an opportunity for a positive transition from work and career roles to stronger family and community member roles, and the latter may have a variety of positive outcomes for the individual. Retirement may be a relief for people who have worked in boring or physically demanding jobs, particularly if they have other outlets for stimulation and expressing self-identity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s03_p02">Psychologist Mo Wang (2007)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_116">Wang, M. (2007). Profiling retirees in the retirement transition and adjustment process: Examining the longitudinal change patterns of retirees’ psychological well-being. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 92</em>(2), 455–474.</span> observed the well-being of 2,060 people between the ages of 51 and 61 over an 8-year period, and made the following recommendations to make the retirement phase a positive one:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s03_l01">
            <li>Continue to work part time past retirement, in order to ease into retirement status slowly.</li>
            <li>Plan for retirement—this is a good idea financially, but also making plans to incorporate other kinds of work or hobbies into postemployment life makes sense.</li>
            <li>Retire with someone—if the retiree is still married, it is a good idea to retire at the same time as a spouse, so that people can continue to work part time and follow a retirement plan together.</li>
            <li>Have a happy marriage—people with marital problems tend to find retirement more stressful because they do not have a positive home life to return to and can no longer seek refuge in long working hours. Couples that work on their marriages can make their retirements a lot easier.</li>
            <li>Take care of physical and financial health—a sound financial plan and good physical health can ensure a healthy, peaceful retirement.</li>
            <li>Retire early from a stressful job—people who stay in stressful jobs for fear that they will lose their pensions or won’t be able to find work somewhere else feel trapped. Toxic environments can take a severe emotional toll on an employee. Leaving early from an unsatisfying job may make retirement a relief.</li>
            <li>Retire “on time”—retiring too early or too late can cause people to feel “out of sync” or to feel they have not achieved their goals.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s03_p03">Whereas these seven tips are helpful for a smooth transition to retirement, Wang also notes that people tend to be adaptable, and that no matter how they do it, retirees will eventually adjust to their new lifestyles.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Death, Dying, and Bereavement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s04_p01">Living includes dealing with our own and our loved ones’ mortality. In her book, <em class="emphasis">On Death and Dying</em> (1997),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_117">Kübler-Ross, E. (1997). <em class="emphasis">On death and dying</em>. New York, NY: Scribner.</span> Elizabeth Kübler-Ross describes five phases of grief through which people pass in grappling with the knowledge that they or someone close to them is dying:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s04_l01">
            <li>Denial: “I feel fine.” “This can’t be happening; not to me.”</li>
            <li>Anger: “Why me? It’s not fair!” “How can this happen to me?” “Who is to blame?”</li>
            <li>Bargaining: “Just let me live to see my children graduate.” “I’d do anything for a few more years.” “I’d give my life savings if…”</li>
            <li>Depression: “I’m so sad, why bother with anything?” “I’m going to die. What’s the point?” “I miss my loved ones—why go on?”</li>
            <li>Acceptance: “I know my time has come; it’s almost my time.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s04_p02">Despite Ross’s popularity, there are a growing number of critics of her theory who argue that her five-stage sequence is too constraining because attitudes toward death and dying have been found to vary greatly across cultures and religions, and these variations make the process of dying different according to culture (Bonanno, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_118">Bonanno, G. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The other side of sadness: What the new science of bereavement tells us about life after a loss</em>. New York, NY: Basic Books.</span> As an example, Japanese Americans restrain their grief (Corr, Nabe, &amp; Corr, 2009)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_119">Corr, C. A., Nabe, C. M., &amp; Corr, D. M. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Death and dying: Life and living</em> (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> so as not to burden other people with their pain. By contrast, Jews observe a 7-day, publicly announced mourning period. In some cultures the elderly are more likely to be living and coping alone, or perhaps only with their spouse, whereas in other cultures, such as the Hispanic culture, the elderly are more likely to be living with their sons and daughters and other relatives, and this social support may create a better quality of life for them (Diaz-Cabello, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_120">Diaz-Cabello, N. (2004). The Hispanic way of dying: Three families, three perspectives, three cultures. <em class="emphasis">Illness, Crisis, &amp; Loss, 12</em>(3), 239–255.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s04_p03">Margaret Stroebe and her colleagues (2008)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_121">Stroebe, M. S., Hansson, R. O., Schut, H., &amp; Stroebe, W. (2008). Bereavement research: Contemporary perspectives. In M. S. Stroebe, R. O. Hansson, H. Schut, &amp; W. Stroebe (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of bereavement research and practice: Advances in theory and intervention</em> (pp. 3–25). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</span> found that although most people adjusted to the loss of a loved one without seeking professional treatment, many had an increased risk of mortality, particularly within the early weeks and months after the loss. These researchers also found that people going through the grieving process suffered more physical and psychological symptoms and illnesses and used more medical services.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s05_s04_p04">The health of survivors during the end of life is influenced by factors such as circumstances surrounding the loved one’s death, individual personalities, and ways of coping. People serving as caretakers to partners or other family members who are ill frequently experience a great deal of stress themselves, making the dying process even more stressful. Despite the trauma of the loss of a loved one, people do recover and are able to continue with effective lives. Grief intervention programs can go a long way in helping people cope during the bereavement period (Neimeyer, Holland, Currier, &amp; Mehta, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn06_122">Neimeyer, R.

                <li>A portion of the elderly suffer from age-related brain diseases, such as dementia, a progressive neurological disease that includes significant loss of cognitive abilities, and Alzheimer’s disease, a fatal form of dementia that is related to changes in the cerebral cortex.</li>
                <li>Two significant social stages in late adulthood are retirement and dealing with grief and bereavement. Studies show that a well-planned retirement can be a pleasant experience.</li>
                <li>A significant number of people going through the grieving process are at increased risk of mortality and physical and mental illness, but grief counseling can be effective in helping these people cope with their loss.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p01">Development begins at conception when a sperm from the father fertilizes an egg from the mother creating a new life. The resulting zygote grows into an embryo and then a fetus.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p02">Babies are born prepared with reflexes and cognitive skills that contribute to their survival and growth.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p03">Piaget’s stage model of cognitive development proposes that children learn through assimilation and accommodation and that cognitive development follows specific sequential stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p04">An important part of development is the attainment of social skills, including the formation of the self-concept and attachment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p05">Adolescence involves rapid physical changes, including puberty, as well as continued cognitive changes. Moral development continues in adolescence. In Western cultures, adolescence blends into emerging adulthood, the period from age 18 until the mid-20s.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p06">Muscle strength, reaction time, cardiac output, and sensory abilities begin to slowly decline in early and middle adulthood. Fertility, particularly for women, also decreases, and women eventually experience menopause.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p07">Most older adults maintain an active lifestyle—remaining as happy or happier than they were when they were younger—and increasingly value their social connections with family and friends.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch06_s06_p08">Although older adults have slower cognitive processing overall (fluid intelligence), their experience in the form of crystallized intelligence, or existing knowledge about the world and the ability to use it, is maintained and even strengthened during aging.
