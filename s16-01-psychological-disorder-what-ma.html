About 1 in every 4 Americans (or over 78 million people) are affected by a psychological disorder during any one year (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_002">Kessler, R.

(2007). <em class="emphasis">Abnormal psychology and modern life</em> (13th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> Psychological disorders have much in common with other medical disorders. They are out of the patient’s control, they may in some cases be treated by drugs, and their treatment is often covered by medical insurance. Like medical problems, psychological disorders have both biological (nature) as well as environmental (nurture) influences. These causal influences are reflected in the bio-psycho-social model of illness (Engel, 1977).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_004">Engel, G. (1977).

The <em class="emphasis">biological component</em> of the bio-psycho-social model refers to the influences on disorder that come from the functioning of the individual’s body. Particularly important are genetic characteristics that make some people more vulnerable to a disorder than others and the influence of neurotransmitters. The <em class="emphasis">psychological component</em> of the bio-psycho-social model refers to the influences that come from the individual, such as patterns of negative thinking and stress responses.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p03">To consider one example, the psychological disorder of schizophrenia has a biological cause because it is known that there are patterns of genes that make a person vulnerable to the disorder (Gejman, Sanders, &amp; Duan, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_005">Gejman, P., Sanders, A., &amp; Duan, J. (2010). The role of genetics in the etiology of schizophrenia. <em class="emphasis">Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 33</em>(1), 35–66. doi:10.1016/j.psc.2009.12.003</span> But whether or not the person with a biological vulnerability experiences the disorder depends in large part on psychological factors such as how the individual responds to the stress he experiences, as well as social factors such as whether or not he is exposed to stressful environments in adolescence and whether or not he has support from people who care about him (Sawa &amp; Snyder, 2002; Walker, Kestler, Bollini, &amp; Hochman, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_006">Sawa, A., &amp; Snyder, S. (2002). Schizophrenia: Diverse approaches to a complex disease. <em class="emphasis">Science, 296</em>(5568), 692–695. doi:10.1126/science.1070532; Walker, E., Kestler, L., Bollini, A., &amp; Hochman, K.

We will use the bio-psycho-social model as a framework for considering the causes and treatments of disorder.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p04">Although they share many characteristics with them, psychological disorders are nevertheless different from medical conditions in important ways. For one, diagnosis of psychological disorders can be more difficult. Although a medical doctor can see cancer in the lungs using an MRI scan or see blocked arteries in the heart using cardiac catheterization, there is no corresponding test for psychological disorder. Current research is beginning to provide more evidence about the role of brain structures in psychological disorder, but for now the brains of people with severe mental disturbances often look identical to those of people without such disturbances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p05">Because there are no clear biological diagnoses, psychological disorders are instead diagnosed on the basis of clinical observations of the behaviors that the individual engages in. These observations find that emotional states and behaviors operate on a continuum, ranging from more “normal” and “accepted” to more “deviant,” “abnormal,” and “unaccepted.” The behaviors that are associated with disorder are in many cases the same behaviors we that engage in our “normal” everyday life. Washing one’s hands is a normal healthy activity, but it can be overdone by those with an <em class="emphasis">obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</em>. It is not unusual to worry about and try to improve one’s body image, but Robert’s struggle with his personal appearance, as discussed at the beginning of this chapter, was clearly unusual, unhealthy, and distressing to him.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p06">Whether a given behavior is considered a psychological disorder is determined not only by whether a behavior is <em class="emphasis">unusual</em> (e.g., whether it is “mild” anxiety versus “extreme” anxiety) but also by whether a behavior is maladaptive—that is, the extent to which it causes <em class="emphasis">distress</em> (e.g., pain and suffering) and <em class="emphasis">dysfunction</em> (impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) to the individual (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_007">American Psychiatric Association. (2000). <em class="emphasis">Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</em> (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.</span> An intense fear of spiders, for example, would not be considered a psychological disorder unless it has a significant negative impact on the sufferer’s life, for instance by causing him or her to be unable to step outside the house. The focus on distress and dysfunction means that behaviors that are simply unusual (such as some political, religious, or sexual practices) are not classified as disorders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p07">Put your psychology hat on for a moment and consider the behaviors of the people listed in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.2 "Diagnosing Disorder"</a>. For each, indicate whether you think the behavior is or is not a psychological disorder. If you’re not sure, what other information would you need to know to be more certain of your diagnosis?</p>

Talking to ourselves out loud is unusual and can be a symptom of schizophrenia, but just because we do it once in a while does not mean that there is anything wrong with us. It is natural to be depressed, particularly in the long winter nights, but how severe should this depression be, and how long should it last? If the negative feelings last for an extended time and begin to lead the person to miss work or classes, then they may become symptoms of a mood disorder. It is normal to worry about things, but when does worry turn into a debilitating anxiety disorder? And what about thoughts that seem to be irrational, such as being able to “speak the language of angels”? Are they indicators of a severe psychological disorder, or part of a normal religious experience? Again, the answer lies in the extent to which they are (or are not) interfering with the individual’s functioning in society.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p11">Until the 18th century, the most common treatment for the mentally ill was to incarcerate them in asylums or “madhouses.” During the 18th century, however, some reformers began to oppose this brutal treatment of the mentally ill, arguing that mental illness was a medical problem that had nothing to do with evil spirits or demons. In France, one of the key reformers was Philippe Pinel (1745–1826), who believed that mental illness was caused by a combination of physical and psychological stressors, exacerbated by inhumane conditions. Pinel advocated the introduction of exercise, fresh air, and daylight for the inmates, as well as treating them gently and talking with them. In America, the reformers Benjamin Rush (1745–1813) and Dorothea Dix (1802–1887) were instrumental in creating mental hospitals that treated patients humanely and attempted to cure them if possible. These reformers saw mental illness as an underlying psychological disorder, which was diagnosed according to its symptoms and which could be cured through treatment.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p13">The stigma of mental disorder affects people while they are ill, while they are healing, and even after they have healed (Schefer, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_011">Schefer, R.

Stigma about mental illness also leads to employment discrimination, despite the fact that with appropriate support, even people with severe psychological disorders are able to hold a job (Boardman, Grove, Perkins, &amp; Shepherd, 2003; Leff &amp; Warner, 2006; Ozawa &amp; Yaeda, 2007; Pulido, Diaz, &amp; Ramirez, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_012">Boardman, J., Grove, B., Perkins, R., &amp; Shepherd, G.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p15">The most significant problem of the stigmatization of those with psychological disorder is that it slows their recovery. People with mental problems internalize societal attitudes about mental illness, often becoming so embarrassed or ashamed that they conceal their difficulties and fail to seek treatment. Stigma leads to lowered self-esteem, increased isolation, and hopelessness, and it may negatively influence the individual’s family and professional life (Hayward &amp; Bright, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_014">Hayward, P., &amp; Bright, J.

It is up to all of us who are informed about the causes of psychological disorder and the impact of these conditions on people to understand, first, that mental illness is not a “fault” any more than is cancer. People do not choose to have a mental illness. Second, we must all work to help overcome the stigma associated with disorder.

Most U.S. insurance companies will not pay for therapy unless the patient has a <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> diagnosis.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_p01">Two common critiques of the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> are that the categorization system leaves quite a bit of ambiguity in diagnosis and that it covers such a wide variety of behaviors. Let’s take a closer look at three common disorders—<em class="emphasis">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</em>, <em class="emphasis">autistic disorder</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Asperger’s disorder</em>—that have recently raised controversy because they are being diagnosed significantly more frequently than they were in the past.</p>

                <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p01">Zack, aged 7 years, has always had trouble settling down. He is easily bored and distracted. In school, he cannot stay in his seat for very long and he frequently does not follow instructions. He is constantly fidgeting or staring into space. Zack has poor social skills and may overreact when someone accidentally bumps into him or uses one of his toys. At home, he chatters constantly and rarely settles down to do a quiet activity, such as reading a book.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p02">Symptoms such as Zack’s are common among 7-year-olds, and particularly among boys. But what do the symptoms mean? Does Zack simply have a lot of energy and a short attention span? Boys mature more slowly than girls at this age, and perhaps Zack will catch up in the next few years. One possibility is for the parents and teachers to work with Zack to help him be more attentive, to put up with the behavior, and to wait it out.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p03">But many parents, often on the advice of the child’s teacher, take their children to a psychologist for diagnosis.

L., &amp; DuPaul, G. (2006). ADHD in college students. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Attention Disorders, 10</em>(1), 9–19.</span> In adults the symptoms of ADHD include forgetfulness, difficulty paying attention to details, procrastination, disorganized work habits, and not listening to others. ADHD is about 70% more likely to occur in males than in females (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_019">Kessler, R. C., Chiu, W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p04">The diagnosis of ADHD has quadrupled over the past 20 years such that it is now diagnosed in about 1 out of every 20 American children and is the most common psychological disorder among children in the world (Olfson, Gameroff, Marcus, &amp; Jensen, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_020">Olfson, M., Gameroff, M., Marcus, S., &amp; Jensen, P.

National trends in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Psychiatry, 160</em>, 1071–1077.</span> ADHD is also being diagnosed much more frequently in adolescents and adults (Barkley, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_021">Barkley, R. A. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment</em> (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> You might wonder what this all means. Are the increases in the diagnosis of ADHD due to the fact that today’s children and adolescents are actually more distracted and hyperactive than their parents were, due to a greater awareness of ADHD among teachers and parents, or due to psychologists and psychiatrists’ tendency to overdiagnose the problem? Perhaps drug companies are also involved, because ADHD is often treated with prescription medications, including stimulants such as Ritalin.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p05">Although skeptics argue that ADHD is overdiagnosed and is a handy excuse for behavioral problems, most psychologists believe that ADHD is a real disorder that is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p05">The child psychiatrist believed that Jared’s language problems and social skills were not severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of autistic disorder and instead proposed a diagnosis of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Asperger’s disorder</a><span class="glossdef">A developmental disorder that affects a child’s ability to socialize and communicate effectively with others and in which symptoms begin before 7 years of age.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a developmental disorder that affects a child’s ability to socialize and communicate effectively with others and in which symptoms begin before 7 years of age</em>. The symptoms of Asperger’s are almost identical to that of autism (with the exception of a delay in language development), and the child psychiatrist simply saw these problems as less extreme.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p06">Imagine how Jared’s parents must have felt at this point. Clearly there is something wrong with their child, but even the experts cannot agree on exactly what the problem is. Diagnosing problems such as Jared’s is difficult, yet the number of children like him is increasing dramatically. Disorders related to autism and Asperger’s disorder now affect almost 1% of American children (Kogan et al., 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_026">Kogan, M., Blumberg, S., Schieve, L., Boyle, C., Perrin, J., Ghandour, R.,…van Dyck, P. (2009). Prevalence of parent-reported diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder among children in the US, 2007. <em class="emphasis">Pediatrics, 124</em>(5), 1395–1403. doi:10.1542/peds.2009-1522</span> The milder forms of autism, and particularly Asperger’s, have accounted for most of this increase in diagnosis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p07">Although for many years autism was thought to be primarily a socially determined disorder, in which parents who were cold, distant, and rejecting created the problem, current research suggests that biological factors are most important. The heritability of autism has been estimated to be as high as 90% (Freitag, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_027">Freitag C. M. (2007). The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: A review of the literature. <em class="emphasis">Molecular Psychiatry, 12</em>(1), 2–22.</span> Scientists speculate that autism is caused by an unknown genetically determined brain abnormality that occurs early in development. It is likely that several different brain sites are affected (Moldin, 2003),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_028">Moldin, S. O. (2003). Editorial: Neurobiology of autism: The new frontier. <em class="emphasis">Genes, Brain &amp; Behavior, 2</em>(5), 253–254.</span> and the search for these areas is being conducted in many scientific laboratories.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p08">But does Jared have autism or Asperger’s? The problem is that diagnosis is not exact (remember the idea of “categories”), and the experts themselves are often unsure how to classify behavior. Furthermore, the appropriate classifications change with time and new knowledge. The American Psychiatric Association has recently posted on its website a proposal to eliminate the term <em class="emphasis">Asperger’s syndrome</em> from the upcoming <em class="emphasis">DSM-V</em>. Whether or not Asperger’s will remain a separate disorder will be made known when the next <em class="emphasis">DSM-V</em> is published in 2013.</p>

                    <li>More psychologists are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorder than in any other endeavor, and those tasks are probably the most important psychologists face.</li>
                    <li>The impact on people with a psychological disorder comes both from the disease itself and from the stigma associated with disorder.</li>
                    <li>A psychological disorder is an ongoing dysfunctional pattern of thought, emotion, and behavior that causes significant distress and that is considered deviant in that person’s culture or society.</li>
                    <li>According to the bio-psycho-social model, psychological disorders have biological, psychological, and social causes.</li>
                    <li>It is difficult to diagnose psychological disorders, although the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> provides guidelines that are based on a category system. The <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> is frequently revised, taking into consideration new knowledge as well as changes in cultural norms about disorder.</li>
                    <li>There is controversy about the diagnosis of disorders such as ADHD, autistic disorder, and Asperger’s disorder.</li>

                    <li>Do you or your friends hold stereotypes about the mentally ill? Can you think of or find clips from any films or other popular media that portray mental illness positively or negatively? Is it more or less acceptable to stereotype the mentally ill than to stereotype other social groups?</li>
                    <li>Consider the psychological disorders listed in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s01_s02_t01">Table 12.3 "Categories of Psychological Disorders Based on the "</a>. Do you know people who may suffer from any of them? Can you or have you talked to them about their experiences? If so, how do they experience the illness?</li>
                    <li>Consider the diagnosis of ADHD, autism, and Asperger’s disorder from the biological, personal, and social-cultural perspectives. Do you think that these disorders are overdiagnosed? How might clinicians determine if ADHD is dysfunctional or distressing to the individual?</li>
