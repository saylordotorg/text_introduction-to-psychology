    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_p01">If you were someone who understood brain anatomy and were to look at the brain of an animal that you had never seen before, you would nevertheless be able to deduce the likely capacities of the animal. This is because the brains of all animals are very similar in overall form. In each animal the brain is layered, and the basic structures of the brain are similar (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_f01">Figure 3.6 "The Major Structures in the Human Brain"</a>). The innermost structures of the brain—the parts nearest the spinal cord—are the oldest part of the brain, and these areas carry out the same the functions they did for our distant ancestors. The “old brain” regulates basic survival functions, such as breathing, moving, resting, and feeding, and creates our experiences of emotion. Mammals, including humans, have developed further brain layers that provide more advanced functions—for instance, better memory, more sophisticated social interactions, and the ability to experience emotions. Humans have a very large and highly developed outer layer known as the <em class="emphasis">cerebral cortex</em> (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_f02">Figure 3.7 "Cerebral Cortex"</a>), which makes us particularly adept at these processes.</p>

The job of the reticular formation is to filter out some of the stimuli that are coming into the brain from the spinal cord and to relay the remainder of the signals to other areas of the brain. The reticular formation also plays important roles in walking, eating, sexual activity, and sleeping. When electrical stimulation is applied to the reticular formation of an animal, it immediately becomes fully awake, and when the reticular formation is severed from the higher brain regions, the animal falls into a deep coma.</p>

Consuming alcohol influences the cerebellum, which is why people who are drunk have more difficulty walking in a straight line. Also, the cerebellum contributes to emotional responses, helps us discriminate between different sounds and textures, and is important in learning (Bower &amp; Parsons, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_006">Bower, J.

They found that the once angry animal immediately became passive and no longer responded to fearful situations with aggressive behavior. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala in other animals also influences aggression. In addition to helping us experience fear, the amygdala also helps us learn from situations that create fear. When we experience events that are dangerous, the amygdala stimulates the brain to remember the details of the situation so that we learn to avoid it in the future (Sigurdsson, Doyère, Cain, &amp; LeDoux, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_009">Sigurdsson, T., Doyère, V., Cain, C.

Through its many interactions with other parts of the brain, the hypothalamus helps regulate body temperature, hunger, thirst, and sex, and responds to the satisfaction of these needs by creating feelings of pleasure.

In one experiment a rat was given the opportunity to electrically stimulate its own hypothalamus by pressing a pedal. The rat enjoyed the experience so much that it pressed the pedal more than 7,000 times per hour until it collapsed from sheer exhaustion.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Cerebral Cortex Creates Consciousness and Thinking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_p01">All animals have adapted to their environments by developing abilities that help them survive. Some animals have hard shells, others run extremely fast, and some have acute hearing. Human beings do not have any of these particular characteristics, but we do have one big advantage over other animals—we are very, very smart.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_p02">You might think that we should be able to determine the intelligence of an animal by looking at the ratio of the animal’s brain weight to the weight of its entire body. But this does not really work. The elephant’s brain is one thousandth of its weight, but the whale’s brain is only one ten-thousandth of its body weight. On the other hand, although the human brain is one 60th of its body weight, the mouse’s brain represents one fortieth of its body weight. Despite these comparisons, elephants do not seem 10 times smarter than whales, and humans definitely seem smarter than mice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_p03">The key to the advanced intelligence of humans is not found in the size of our brains.

Furthermore, they discovered an important and unexpected principle of brain activity. They found that stimulating the right side of the brain produced movement in the left side of the dog’s body, and vice versa. This finding follows from a general principle about how the brain is structured, called <em class="emphasis">contralateral control</em>. The brain is wired such that in most cases the left hemisphere receives sensations from and controls the right side of the body, and vice versa.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p02">Fritsch and Hitzig also found that the movement that followed the brain stimulation only occurred when they stimulated a specific arch-shaped region that runs across the top of the brain from ear to ear, just at the front of the parietal lobe (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 3.11 "The Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex"</a>).

More recent research has mapped the motor cortex even more fully, by providing mild electronic stimulation to different areas of the motor cortex in fully conscious patients while observing their bodily responses (because the brain has no sensory receptors, these patients feel no pain). As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 3.11 "The Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex"</a>, this research has revealed that the motor cortex is specialized for providing control over the body, in the sense that the parts of the body that require more precise and finer movements, such as the face and the hands, also are allotted the greatest amount of cortical space.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p01">The control of some specific bodily functions, such as movement, vision, and hearing, is performed in specified areas of the cortex, and if these areas are damaged, the individual will likely lose the ability to perform the corresponding function. For instance, if an infant suffers damage to facial recognition areas in the temporal lobe, it is likely that he or she will never be able to recognize faces (Farah, Rabinowitz, Quinn, &amp; Liu, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_017">Farah, M.

Early commitment of neural substrates for face recognition. <em class="emphasis">Cognitive Neuropsychology, 17</em>(1–3), 117–123.</span> On the other hand, the brain is not divided up in an entirely rigid way. The brain’s neurons have a remarkable capacity to reorganize and extend themselves to carry out particular functions in response to the needs of the organism, and to repair damage. As a result, the brain constantly creates new neural communication routes and rewires existing ones. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Neuroplasticity</a><span class="glossdef">The brain’s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience or damage.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the brain’s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience or damage</em>. Neuroplasticity enables us to learn and remember new things and adjust to new experiences.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p02">Our brains are the most “plastic” when we are young children, as it is during this time that we learn the most about our environment. On the other hand, neuroplasticity continues to be observed even in adults (Kolb &amp; Fantie, 1989).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_018">Kolb, B., &amp; Fantie, B. (1989).

New York, NY: Plenum Press.</span> The principles of neuroplasticity help us understand how our brains develop to reflect our experiences. For instance, accomplished musicians have a larger auditory cortex compared with the general population (Bengtsson et al., 2005)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_019">Bengtsson, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p03">Plasticity is also observed when there is damage to the brain or to parts of the body that are represented in the motor and sensory cortexes. When a tumor in the left hemisphere of the brain impairs language, the right hemisphere will begin to compensate to help the person recover the ability to speak (Thiel et al., 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_021">Thiel, A., Habedank, B., Herholz, K., Kessler, J., Winhuisen, L., Haupt, W.

As a result, the patient essentially becomes a person with two separate brains. Because the left and right hemispheres are separated, each hemisphere develops a mind of its own, with its own sensations, concepts, and motivations (Gazzaniga, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_026">Gazzaniga, M.

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p06">In their research, Gazzaniga and his colleagues tested the ability of W. J. to recognize and respond to objects and written passages that were presented to only the left or to only the right brain hemispheres (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.12 "Visual and Verbal Processing in the Split-Brain Patient"</a>). The researchers had W. J. look straight ahead and then flashed, for a fraction of a second, a picture of a geometrical shape to the left of where he was looking. By doing so, they assured that—because the two hemispheres had been separated—the image of the shape was experienced only in the right brain hemisphere (remember that sensory input from the left side of the body is sent to the right side of the brain). Gazzaniga and his colleagues found that W. J. was able to identify what he had been shown when he was asked to pick the object from a series of shapes, using his left hand, but that he could not do this when the object was shown in the right visual field. On the other hand, W. J. could easily read written material presented in the right visual field (and thus experienced in the left hemisphere) but not when it was presented in the left visual field.</p>

                    <p class="para">The information that is presented on the left side of our field of vision is transmitted to the right brain hemisphere, and vice versa. In split-brain patients, the severed corpus callosum does not permit information to be transferred between hemispheres, which allows researchers to learn about the functions of each hemisphere. In the sample on the left, the split-brain patient could not choose which image had been presented because the left hemisphere cannot process visual information.  In the sample on the right the patient could not read the passage because the right brain hemisphere cannot process language.</p>

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p07">This research, and many other studies following it, has demonstrated that the two brain hemispheres specialize in different abilities. In most people the ability to speak, write, and understand language is located in the left hemisphere. This is why W. J. could read passages that were presented on the right side and thus transmitted to the left hemisphere, but could not read passages that were only experienced in the right brain hemisphere. The left hemisphere is also better at math and at judging time and rhythm. It is also superior in coordinating the order of complex movements—for example, lip movements needed for speech. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, has only very limited verbal abilities, and yet it excels in perceptual skills. The right hemisphere is able to recognize objects, including faces, patterns, and melodies, and it can put a puzzle together or draw a picture. This is why W. J. could pick out the image when he saw it on the left, but not the right, visual field.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p08">Although Gazzaniga’s research demonstrated that the brain is in fact lateralized, such that the two hemispheres specialize in different activities, this does not mean that when people behave in a certain way or perform a certain activity they are only using one hemisphere of their brains at a time. That would be drastically oversimplifying the concept of brain differences. We normally use both hemispheres at the same time, and the difference between the abilities of the two hemispheres is not absolute (Soroker et al., 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_027">Soroker, N., Kasher, A., Giora, R., Batori, G., Corn, C., Gil, M., &amp; Zaidel, E.

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p09">Across cultures and ethnic groups, about 90% of people are mainly right-handed, whereas only 10% are primarily left-handed (Peters, Reimers, &amp; Manning, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_028">Peters, M., Reimers, S., &amp; Manning, J.

The existence of right-handers and left-handers provides an interesting example of the relationship among evolution, biology, and social factors and how the same phenomenon can be understood at different levels of analysis (Harris, 1990; McManus, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_029">Harris, L.

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p10">At least some handedness is determined by genetics.

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p11">But culture also plays a role. In the past, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hands in many countries, and this practice continues, particularly in collectivistic cultures, such as India and Japan, where left-handedness is viewed negatively as compared with individualistic societies, such as the United States. For example, India has about half as many left-handers as the United States (Ida &amp; Mandal, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_033">Ida, Y., &amp; Mandal, M. K. (2003).

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p12">There are both advantages and disadvantages to being left-handed in a world where most people are right-handed. One problem for lefties is that the world is designed for right-handers. Automatic teller machines (ATMs), classroom desks, scissors, microscopes, drill presses, and table saws are just some examples of everyday machinery that is designed with the most important controls on the right side. This may explain in part why left-handers suffer somewhat more accidents than do right-handers (Dutta &amp; Mandal, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_034">Dutta, T., &amp; Mandal, M.

Throughout history, a number of prominent artists have been left-handed, including Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Pablo Picasso, and Max Escher. Because the right hemisphere is superior in imaging and visual abilities, there may be some advantage to using the left hand for drawing or painting (Springer &amp; Deutsch, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_035">Springer, S. P., &amp; Deutsch, G. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Left brain, right brain: Perspectives from cognitive neuroscience</em> (5th ed.). A series of books in psychology. New York, NY: W. H. Freeman/Times Books/Henry Holt &amp; Co.</span> Left-handed people are also better at envisioning three-dimensional objects, which may explain why there is such a high number of left-handed architects, artists, and chess players in proportion to their numbers (Coren, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_036">Coren, S.

(2007). <em class="emphasis">Left-handedness: Association with immune disease, migraine, and developmental learning disorder</em>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</span> perhaps due to the fact that a small minority of left-handers owe their handedness to a birth trauma, such as being born prematurely (Betancur, Vélez, Cabanieu, &amp; le Moal, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_038">Betancur, C., Vélez, A., Cabanieu, G., &amp; le Moal, M.

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p14">In sports in which handedness may matter, such as tennis, boxing, fencing, or judo, left-handers may have an advantage. They play many games against right-handers and learn how to best handle their styles. Right-handers, however, play very few games against left-handers, which may make them more vulnerable. This explains why a disproportionately high number of left-handers are found in sports where direct one-on-one action predominates. In other sports, such as golf, there are fewer left-handed players because the handedness of one player has no effect on the competition.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p15">The fact that left-handers excel in some sports suggests the possibility that they may have also had an evolutionary advantage because their ancestors may have been more successful in important skills such as hand-to-hand combat (Bodmer &amp; McKie, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_039">Bodmer, W., &amp; McKie, R.
