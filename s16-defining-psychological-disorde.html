        <h3 class="title">When Minor Body Imperfections Lead to Suicide</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p01">“I think we probably noticed in his early teens that he became very conscious about aspects of his appearance…he began to brood over it quite a lot,” said Maria as she called in to the talk radio program to describe her son Robert.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p02">Maria described how Robert had begun to worry about his weight. A friend had commented that he had a “fat” stomach, and Robert began to cut down on eating. Then he began to worry that he wasn’t growing enough and devised an elaborate series of stretching techniques to help him get taller.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p03">Robert scrutinized his face and body in the mirror for hours, finding a variety of imagined defects. He believed that his nose was crooked, and he was particularly concerned about a lump that he saw on it: “A small lump,” said his mother. “I should say it wasn’t very significant, but it was significant to him.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p04">Robert insisted that all his misery stemmed from this lump on his nose, that everybody noticed it. In his sophomore year of high school, he had cosmetic surgery to remove it.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p05">Around this time, Robert had his first panic attack and began to worry that everybody could notice him sweating and blushing in public. He asked his parents for a $10,000 loan, which he said was for overseas study. He used the money for a procedure designed to reduce sweating and blushing. Then, dissatisfied with the results, he had the procedure reversed.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p06">Robert was diagnosed with <em class="emphasis">body dysmorphic disorder</em>. His mother told the radio host,</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch12_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p07">At the time we were really happy because we thought that finally we actually knew what we were trying to fight and to be quite honest, I must admit I thought well it sounds pretty trivial.…</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p08">…Things seemed to go quite well and he got a new girlfriend and he was getting excellent marks in his clinical work in hospital and he promised us that he wasn't going to have any more surgery.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p09">However, a lighthearted comment from a friend about a noticeable vein in his forehead prompted a relapse. Robert had surgery to tie off the vein. When that didn’t solve all his problems as he had hoped, he attempted to have the procedure reversed but learned that it would require complicated microsurgery. He then used injections on himself to try opening the vein again, but he could never completely reverse the first surgery.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_p10">Robert committed suicide shortly afterward, in 2001 (Mitchell, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_001">Mitchell, N. (Producer).

They are out of the patient’s control, they may in some cases be treated by drugs, and their treatment is often covered by medical insurance. Like medical problems, psychological disorders have both biological (nature) as well as environmental (nurture) influences. These causal influences are reflected in the bio-psycho-social model of illness (Engel, 1977).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_004">Engel, G. (1977).

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p03">To consider one example, the psychological disorder of schizophrenia has a biological cause because it is known that there are patterns of genes that make a person vulnerable to the disorder (Gejman, Sanders, &amp; Duan, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_005">Gejman, P., Sanders, A., &amp; Duan, J.

We will use the bio-psycho-social model as a framework for considering the causes and treatments of disorder.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p04">Although they share many characteristics with them, psychological disorders are nevertheless different from medical conditions in important ways. For one, diagnosis of psychological disorders can be more difficult. Although a medical doctor can see cancer in the lungs using an MRI scan or see blocked arteries in the heart using cardiac catheterization, there is no corresponding test for psychological disorder. Current research is beginning to provide more evidence about the role of brain structures in psychological disorder, but for now the brains of people with severe mental disturbances often look identical to those of people without such disturbances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p05">Because there are no clear biological diagnoses, psychological disorders are instead diagnosed on the basis of clinical observations of the behaviors that the individual engages in. These observations find that emotional states and behaviors operate on a continuum, ranging from more “normal” and “accepted” to more “deviant,” “abnormal,” and “unaccepted.” The behaviors that are associated with disorder are in many cases the same behaviors we that engage in our “normal” everyday life. Washing one’s hands is a normal healthy activity, but it can be overdone by those with an <em class="emphasis">obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</em>. It is not unusual to worry about and try to improve one’s body image, but Robert’s struggle with his personal appearance, as discussed at the beginning of this chapter, was clearly unusual, unhealthy, and distressing to him.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p06">Whether a given behavior is considered a psychological disorder is determined not only by whether a behavior is <em class="emphasis">unusual</em> (e.g., whether it is “mild” anxiety versus “extreme” anxiety) but also by whether a behavior is maladaptive—that is, the extent to which it causes <em class="emphasis">distress</em> (e.g., pain and suffering) and <em class="emphasis">dysfunction</em> (impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) to the individual (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_007">American Psychiatric Association. (2000). <em class="emphasis">Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</em> (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.</span> An intense fear of spiders, for example, would not be considered a psychological disorder unless it has a significant negative impact on the sufferer’s life, for instance by causing him or her to be unable to step outside the house. The focus on distress and dysfunction means that behaviors that are simply unusual (such as some political, religious, or sexual practices) are not classified as disorders.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p08">A trained clinical psychologist would have checked off “need more information” for each of the examples in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.2 "Diagnosing Disorder"</a> because although the behaviors may seem unusual, there is no clear evidence that they are distressing or dysfunctional for the person. Talking to ourselves out loud is unusual and can be a symptom of schizophrenia, but just because we do it once in a while does not mean that there is anything wrong with us. It is natural to be depressed, particularly in the long winter nights, but how severe should this depression be, and how long should it last? If the negative feelings last for an extended time and begin to lead the person to miss work or classes, then they may become symptoms of a mood disorder. It is normal to worry about things, but when does worry turn into a debilitating anxiety disorder? And what about thoughts that seem to be irrational, such as being able to “speak the language of angels”? Are they indicators of a severe psychological disorder, or part of a normal religious experience? Again, the answer lies in the extent to which they are (or are not) interfering with the individual’s functioning in society.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p09">Another difficulty in diagnosing psychological disorders is that they frequently occur together.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p11">Until the 18th century, the most common treatment for the mentally ill was to incarcerate them in asylums or “madhouses.” During the 18th century, however, some reformers began to oppose this brutal treatment of the mentally ill, arguing that mental illness was a medical problem that had nothing to do with evil spirits or demons. In France, one of the key reformers was Philippe Pinel (1745–1826), who believed that mental illness was caused by a combination of physical and psychological stressors, exacerbated by inhumane conditions. Pinel advocated the introduction of exercise, fresh air, and daylight for the inmates, as well as treating them gently and talking with them. In America, the reformers Benjamin Rush (1745–1813) and Dorothea Dix (1802–1887) were instrumental in creating mental hospitals that treated patients humanely and attempted to cure them if possible. These reformers saw mental illness as an underlying psychological disorder, which was diagnosed according to its symptoms and which could be cured through treatment.</p>

Stigma about mental illness also leads to employment discrimination, despite the fact that with appropriate support, even people with severe psychological disorders are able to hold a job (Boardman, Grove, Perkins, &amp; Shepherd, 2003; Leff &amp; Warner, 2006; Ozawa &amp; Yaeda, 2007; Pulido, Diaz, &amp; Ramirez, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_012">Boardman, J., Grove, B., Perkins, R., &amp; Shepherd, G.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s01_p15">The most significant problem of the stigmatization of those with psychological disorder is that it slows their recovery. People with mental problems internalize societal attitudes about mental illness, often becoming so embarrassed or ashamed that they conceal their difficulties and fail to seek treatment.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s02_p05">Each revision of the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> takes into consideration new knowledge as well as changes in cultural norms about disorder. Homosexuality, for example, was listed as a mental disorder in the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> until 1973, when it was removed in response to advocacy by politically active gay rights groups and changing social norms. The current version of the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> lists about 400 disorders.

Most U.S. insurance companies will not pay for therapy unless the patient has a <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> diagnosis.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_p01">Two common critiques of the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> are that the categorization system leaves quite a bit of ambiguity in diagnosis and that it covers such a wide variety of behaviors. Let’s take a closer look at three common disorders—<em class="emphasis">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</em>, <em class="emphasis">autistic disorder</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Asperger’s disorder</em>—that have recently raised controversy because they are being diagnosed significantly more frequently than they were in the past.</p>

                <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p01">Zack, aged 7 years, has always had trouble settling down. He is easily bored and distracted. In school, he cannot stay in his seat for very long and he frequently does not follow instructions. He is constantly fidgeting or staring into space. Zack has poor social skills and may overreact when someone accidentally bumps into him or uses one of his toys. At home, he chatters constantly and rarely settles down to do a quiet activity, such as reading a book.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p02">Symptoms such as Zack’s are common among 7-year-olds, and particularly among boys. But what do the symptoms mean? Does Zack simply have a lot of energy and a short attention span? Boys mature more slowly than girls at this age, and perhaps Zack will catch up in the next few years. One possibility is for the parents and teachers to work with Zack to help him be more attentive, to put up with the behavior, and to wait it out.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p03">But many parents, often on the advice of the child’s teacher, take their children to a psychologist for diagnosis. If Zack were taken for testing today, it is very likely that he would be diagnosed with a psychological disorder known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a><span class="glossdef">A developmental behavior disorder characterized by problems with focus, difficulty maintaining attention, and inability to concentrate, in which symptoms start before 7 years of age.</span></span>.

L., &amp; DuPaul, G. (2006). ADHD in college students. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Attention Disorders, 10</em>(1), 9–19.</span> In adults the symptoms of ADHD include forgetfulness, difficulty paying attention to details, procrastination, disorganized work habits, and not listening to others. ADHD is about 70% more likely to occur in males than in females (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_019">Kessler, R. C., Chiu, W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p04">The diagnosis of ADHD has quadrupled over the past 20 years such that it is now diagnosed in about 1 out of every 20 American children and is the most common psychological disorder among children in the world (Olfson, Gameroff, Marcus, &amp; Jensen, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_020">Olfson, M., Gameroff, M., Marcus, S., &amp; Jensen, P. (2003). National trends in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Psychiatry, 160</em>, 1071–1077.</span> ADHD is also being diagnosed much more frequently in adolescents and adults (Barkley, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_021">Barkley, R. A. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment</em> (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> You might wonder what this all means. Are the increases in the diagnosis of ADHD due to the fact that today’s children and adolescents are actually more distracted and hyperactive than their parents were, due to a greater awareness of ADHD among teachers and parents, or due to psychologists and psychiatrists’ tendency to overdiagnose the problem? Perhaps drug companies are also involved, because ADHD is often treated with prescription medications, including stimulants such as Ritalin.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p05">Although skeptics argue that ADHD is overdiagnosed and is a handy excuse for behavioral problems, most psychologists believe that ADHD is a real disorder that is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Twin studies have found that ADHD is heritable (National Institute of Mental Health, 2008),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_022">National Institute of Mental Health.

            <span class="blockquote block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p01">Jared’s kindergarten teacher has voiced her concern to Jared’s parents about his difficulties with interacting with other children and his delay in developing normal language. Jared is able to maintain eye contact and enjoys mixing with other children, but he cannot communicate with them very well. He often responds to questions or comments with long-winded speeches about trucks or some other topic that interests him, and he seems to lack awareness of other children’s wishes and needs.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p02">Jared’s concerned parents took him to a multidisciplinary child development center for consultation. Here he was tested by a pediatric neurologist, a psychologist, and a child psychiatrist.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p03">The pediatric neurologist found that Jared’s hearing was normal, and there were no signs of any neurological disorder. He diagnosed Jared with a <em class="emphasis">pervasive developmental disorder</em>, because while his comprehension and expressive language was poor, he was still able to carry out nonverbal tasks, such as drawing a picture or doing a puzzle.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p04">Based on her observation of Jared’s difficulty interacting with his peers, and the fact that he did not respond warmly to his parents, the psychologist diagnosed Jared with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">autistic disorder (autism)</a><span class="glossdef">A disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior and in which symptoms begin before 7 years of age.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior, and in which symptoms begin before 7 years of age</em>. The psychologist believed that the autism diagnosis was correct because, like other children with autism, Jared, has a poorly developed ability to see the world from the perspective of others; engages in unusual behaviors such as talking about trucks for hours; and responds to stimuli, such as the sound of a car or an airplane, in unusual ways.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p05">The child psychiatrist believed that Jared’s language problems and social skills were not severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of autistic disorder and instead proposed a diagnosis of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Asperger’s disorder</a><span class="glossdef">A developmental disorder that affects a child’s ability to socialize and communicate effectively with others and in which symptoms begin before 7 years of age.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a developmental disorder that affects a child’s ability to socialize and communicate effectively with others and in which symptoms begin before 7 years of age</em>. The symptoms of Asperger’s are almost identical to that of autism (with the exception of a delay in language development), and the child psychiatrist simply saw these problems as less extreme.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p06">Imagine how Jared’s parents must have felt at this point. Clearly there is something wrong with their child, but even the experts cannot agree on exactly what the problem is. Diagnosing problems such as Jared’s is difficult, yet the number of children like him is increasing dramatically. Disorders related to autism and Asperger’s disorder now affect almost 1% of American children (Kogan et al., 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_026">Kogan, M., Blumberg, S., Schieve, L., Boyle, C., Perrin, J., Ghandour, R.,…van Dyck, P. (2009). Prevalence of parent-reported diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder among children in the US, 2007. <em class="emphasis">Pediatrics, 124</em>(5), 1395–1403. doi:10.1542/peds.2009-1522</span> The milder forms of autism, and particularly Asperger’s, have accounted for most of this increase in diagnosis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p07">Although for many years autism was thought to be primarily a socially determined disorder, in which parents who were cold, distant, and rejecting created the problem, current research suggests that biological factors are most important. The heritability of autism has been estimated to be as high as 90% (Freitag, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_027">Freitag C. M. (2007). The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: A review of the literature. <em class="emphasis">Molecular Psychiatry, 12</em>(1), 2–22.</span> Scientists speculate that autism is caused by an unknown genetically determined brain abnormality that occurs early in development. It is likely that several different brain sites are affected (Moldin, 2003),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_028">Moldin, S. O. (2003). Editorial: Neurobiology of autism: The new frontier. <em class="emphasis">Genes, Brain &amp; Behavior, 2</em>(5), 253–254.</span> and the search for these areas is being conducted in many scientific laboratories.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s01_s03_s02_p08">But does Jared have autism or Asperger’s? The problem is that diagnosis is not exact (remember the idea of “categories”), and the experts themselves are often unsure how to classify behavior. Furthermore, the appropriate classifications change with time and new knowledge. The American Psychiatric Association has recently posted on its website a proposal to eliminate the term <em class="emphasis">Asperger’s syndrome</em> from the upcoming <em class="emphasis">DSM-V</em>. Whether or not Asperger’s will remain a separate disorder will be made known when the next <em class="emphasis">DSM-V</em> is published in 2013.</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s01_p02">For a few months now I’ve had a really bad feeling inside of me. The best way to describe it is like a really bad feeling of negative inevitability, like something really bad is impending, but I don’t know what. It’s like I’m on trial for murder or I’m just waiting to be sent down for something. I have it all of the time but it gets worse in waves that come from nowhere with no apparent triggers. I used to get it before going out for nights out with friends, and it kinda stopped me from doing it as I’d rather not go out and stress about the feeling, but now I have it all the time so it doesn’t really make a difference anymore.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s01_p04">In addition to their feelings of anxiety, people who suffer from GAD may also experience a variety of physical symptoms, including irritability, sleep troubles, difficulty concentrating, muscle aches, trembling, perspiration, and hot flashes.

I was driving home, my three little girls were in their car seats in the back, and all of a sudden I couldn’t breathe, I broke out into a sweat, and my heart began racing and literally beating against my ribs! I thought I was going to die. I pulled off the road and put my head on the wheel. I remember songs playing on the CD for about 15 minutes and my kids’ voices singing along. I was sure I’d never see them again. And then, it passed. I slowly got back on the road and drove home. I had no idea what it was.

Symptoms of a panic attack include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, trembling, dizziness, choking sensations, nausea, and an intense feeling of dread or impending doom. Panic attacks can often be mistaken for heart attacks or other serious physical illnesses, and they may lead the person experiencing them to go to a hospital emergency room. Panic attacks may last as little as one or as much as 20 minutes, but they often peak and subside within about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s02_p03">Sufferers are often anxious because they fear that they will have another attack. They focus their attention on the thoughts and images of their fears, becoming excessively sensitive to cues that signal the possibility of threat (MacLeod, Rutherford, Campbell, Ebsworthy, &amp; Holker, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_034">MacLeod, C., Rutherford, E., Campbell, L., Ebsworthy, G., &amp; Holker, L.

As a result, they may begin to avoid places where attacks have occurred in the past, such as driving, using an elevator, or being in public places. Panic disorder affects about 3% of the American population in a given year.</p>

The fear experience can range from a sense of unease to a full-blown panic attack. Most people learn to live with their phobias, but for others the fear can be so debilitating that they go to extremes to avoid the fearful situation. A sufferer of arachnophobia (fear of spiders), for example, may refuse to enter a room until it has been checked thoroughly for spiders, or may refuse to vacation in the countryside because spiders may be there. Phobias are characterized by their specificity and their irrationality. A person with acrophobia (a fear of height) could fearlessly sail around the world on a sailboat with no concerns yet refuse to go out onto the balcony on the fifth floor of a building.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s03_p02">A common phobia is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social phobia</a><span class="glossdef">Extreme shyness around people or discomfort in social situations.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">extreme shyness around people or discomfort in social situations</em>. Social phobia may be specific to a certain event, such as speaking in public or using a public restroom, or it can be a more generalized anxiety toward almost all people outside of close family and friends. People with social phobia will often experience physical symptoms in public, such as sweating profusely, blushing, stuttering, nausea, and dizziness. They are convinced that everybody around them notices these symptoms as they are occurring. Women are somewhat more likely than men to suffer from social phobia.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s04_p02">David Beckham’s experience with obsessive behavior is not unusual. We all get a little obsessive at times. We may continuously replay a favorite song in our heads, worry about getting the right outfit for an upcoming party, or find ourselves analyzing a series of numbers that seem to have a certain pattern. And our everyday compulsions can be useful. Going back inside the house once more to be sure that we really did turn off the sink faucet or checking the mirror a couple of times to be sure that our hair is combed are not necessarily bad ideas.</p>

OCD is diagnosed when the obsessive thoughts are so disturbing and the compulsive behaviors are so time consuming that they cause distress and significant dysfunction in a person’s everyday life. Washing your hands once or even twice to make sure that they are clean is normal; washing them 20 times is not. Keeping your fridge neat is a good idea; spending hours a day on it is not. The sufferers know that these rituals are senseless, but they cannot bring themselves to stop them, in part because the relief that they feel after they perform them acts as a reinforcer, making the behavior more likely to occur again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s04_p04">Sufferers of OCD may avoid certain places that trigger the obsessive thoughts, or use alcohol or drugs to try to calm themselves down. OCD has a low prevalence rate (about 1% of the population in a given year) in relation to other anxiety disorders, and usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood (Horwath &amp; Weissman, 2000; Samuels &amp; Nestadt, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_038">Horwath, E., &amp; Weissman, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p03">Whether the genetic predisposition to anxiety becomes expressed as a disorder depends on environmental factors. People who were abused in childhood are more likely to be anxious than those who had normal childhoods, even with the same genetic disposition to anxiety sensitivity (Stein, Schork, &amp; Gelernter, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_059">Stein, M., Schork, N., &amp; Gelernter, J. (2008).

One problem is that modern life creates a lot of anxiety. Although our life expectancy and quality of life have improved over the past 50 years, the same period has also created a sharp increase in anxiety levels (Twenge, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_060">Twenge, J. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Generation me</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span> These changes suggest that most anxiety disorders stem from perceived, rather than actual, threats to our well-being.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p04">Anxieties are also learned through classical and operant conditioning. Just as rats that are shocked in their cages develop a chronic anxiety toward their laboratory environment (which has become a conditioned stimulus for fear), rape victims may feel anxiety when passing by the scene of the crime, and victims of PTSD may react to memories or reminders of the stressful event. Classical conditioning may also be accompanied by <em class="emphasis">stimulus generalization</em>. A single dog bite can lead to generalized fear of all dogs; a panic attack that follows an embarrassing moment in one place may be generalized to a fear of all public places. People’s responses to their anxieties are often reinforced. Behaviors become compulsive because they provide relief from the torment of anxious thoughts. Similarly, leaving or avoiding fear-inducing stimuli leads to feelings of calmness or relief, which reinforces phobic behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p05">In contrast to the anxiety disorders, the causes of the dissociative orders are less clear, which is part of the reason that there is disagreement about their existence. Unlike most psychological orders, there is little evidence of a genetic predisposition; they seem to be almost entirely environmentally determined. Severe emotional trauma during childhood, such as physical or sexual abuse, coupled with a strong stressor, is typically cited as the underlying cause (Alpher, 1992; Cardeña &amp; Gleaves, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_061">Alpher, V.

                <li>Anxiety is a natural part of life, but too much anxiety can be debilitating. Every year millions of people suffer from anxiety disorders.</li>
                <li>People who suffer from generalized anxiety disorder experience anxiety, as well as a variety of physical symptoms.</li>
                <li>Panic disorder involves the experience of panic attacks, including shortness of breath, heart palpitations, trembling, and dizziness.</li>
                <li>Phobias are specific fears of a certain object, situation, or activity. Phobias are characterized by their specificity and their irrationality.</li>
                <li>A common phobia is social phobia, extreme shyness around people or discomfort in social situations.</li>
                <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is diagnosed when a person’s repetitive thoughts are so disturbing and their compulsive behaviors so time consuming that they cause distress and significant disruption in a person’s everyday life.</li>
                <li>People who have survived a terrible ordeal, such as combat, torture, rape, imprisonment, abuse, natural disasters, or the death of someone close to them, may develop PTSD.</li>
                <li>Dissociative disorders, including dissociative amnesia and dissociative fugue, are conditions that involve disruptions or breakdowns of memory, awareness, and identity. The dissociation is used as a defense against the trauma.</li>
                <li>Dissociative identity disorder, in which two or more distinct and individual personalities exist in the same person, is relatively rare and difficult to diagnose.</li>
                <li>Both nature and nurture contribute to the development of anxiety disorders.</li>

Over the past several years she had been treated by a psychologist for depression, but for the past few months she had been feeling a lot better.

Although the normal pattern involves swings from high to low, in some cases the person may experience both highs and lows at the same time. Determining whether a person has bipolar disorder is difficult due to the frequent presence of comorbidity with both depression and anxiety disorders. Bipolar disorder is more likely to be diagnosed when it is initially observed at an early age, when the frequency of depressive episodes is high, and when there is a sudden onset of the symptoms (Bowden, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_074">Bowden, C.

            <h3 class="title">Research Focus: Using Molecular Genetics to Unravel the Causes of Depression</h3>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p03">Avshalom Caspi and his colleagues (Caspi et al., 2003)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_080">Caspi, A., Sugden, K., Moffitt, T. E., Taylor, A., Craig, I. W., Harrington, H.,…Poulton, R. (2003). Influence of life stress on depression: Moderation by a polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene. <em class="emphasis">Science, 301</em>(5631), 386–389.</span> used a longitudinal study to test whether genetic predispositions might lead some people, but not others, to suffer from depression as a result of environmental stress. Their research focused on a particular gene, the 5-HTT gene, which is known to be important in the production and use of the neurotransmitter <em class="emphasis">serotonin</em>. The researchers focused on this gene because serotonin is known to be important in depression, and because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in treating depression.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p04">People who experience stressful life events, for instance involving threat, loss, humiliation, or defeat, are likely to experience depression. But biological-situational models suggest that a person’s sensitivity to stressful events depends on his or her genetic makeup. The researchers therefore expected that people with one type of genetic pattern would show depression following stress to a greater extent than people with a different type of genetic pattern.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p05">The research included a sample of 1,037 adults from Dunedin, New Zealand. Genetic analysis on the basis of DNA samples allowed the researchers to divide the sample into two groups on the basis of the characteristics of their 5-HTT gene. One group had a short version (or <em class="emphasis">allele</em>) of the gene, whereas the other group did not have the short allele of the gene.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p06">The participants also completed a measure where they indicated the number and severity of stressful life events that they had experienced over the past 5 years. The events included employment, financial, housing, health, and relationship stressors. The dependent measure in the study was the level of depression reported by the participant, as assessed using a structured interview test (Robins, Cottler, Bucholtz, &amp; Compton, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_081">Robins, L.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p07">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s03_s03_f01">Figure 12.12 "Results From Caspi et al., 2003"</a>, as the number of stressful experiences the participants reported increased from 0 to 4, depression also significantly increased for the participants with the short version of the gene (top panel). But for the participants who did not have a short allele, increasing stress did not increase depression (bottom panel). Furthermore, for the participants who experienced 4 stressors over the past 5 years, 33% of the participants who carried the short version of the gene became depressed, whereas only 17% of participants who did not have the short version did.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p09">But psychological and social determinants are also important in creating mood disorders and depression. In terms of psychological characteristics, mood states are influenced in large part by our cognitions. Negative thoughts about ourselves and our relationships to others create negative moods, and a goal of cognitive therapy for mood disorders is to attempt to change people’s cognitions to be more positive. Negative moods also create negative behaviors toward others, such as acting sad, slouching, and avoiding others, which may lead those others to respond negatively to the person, for instance by isolating that person, which then creates even more depression (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s03_s03_f02">Figure 12.13 "Cycle of Depression"</a>). You can see how it might become difficult for people to break out of this “cycle of depression.”</p>

These differences seem to be due to discrepancies between individual feelings and cultural expectations about what one <em class="emphasis">should</em> feel. People from European and American cultures report that it is important to experience emotions such as happiness and excitement, whereas the Chinese report that it is more important to be stable and calm. Because Americans may feel that they are not happy or excited but that they are supposed to be, this may increase their depression (Tsai, Knutson, &amp; Fung, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_083">Tsai, J.

                <li>Mood is the positive or negative feelings that are in the background of our everyday experiences.</li>
                <li>We all may get depressed in our daily lives, but people who suffer from mood disorders tend to experience more intense—and particularly more intense negative—moods.</li>
                <li>The most common symptom of mood disorders is negative mood.</li>
                <li>If a person experiences mild but long-lasting depression, she will be diagnosed with dysthymia. If the depression continues and becomes even more severe, the diagnosis may become that of major depressive disorder.</li>
                <li>Bipolar disorder is characterized by swings in mood from overly “high” to sad and hopeless, and back again, with periods of near-normal mood in between.</li>
                <li>Mood disorders are caused by the interplay among biological, psychological, and social variables.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p03">Neuroimaging studies have found some differences in brain structure between schizophrenic and normal patients. In some people with schizophrenia, the cerebral ventricles (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) are enlarged (Suddath, Christison, Torrey, Casanova, &amp; Weinberger, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_102">Suddath, R.

This would explain the deterioration of functioning in language and thought processing that is commonly experienced by schizophrenic patients (Galderisi et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_103">Galderisi, S., Quarantelli, M., Volper, U., Mucci, A., Cassano, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p04">Many researchers believe that schizophrenia is caused in part by excess dopamine, and this theory is supported by the fact that most of the drugs useful in treating schizophrenia inhibit dopamine activity in the brain (Javitt &amp; Laruelle, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_104">Javitt, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p05">A genetic predisposition to developing schizophrenia does not always develop into the actual disorder.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p06">One hypothesis is that schizophrenia is caused in part by disruptions to normal brain development in infancy that may be caused by poverty, malnutrition, and disease (Brown et al., 2004; Murray &amp; Bramon, 2005; Susser et al., 1996; Waddington, Lane, Larkin, O’Callaghan, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_108">Brown, A.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p01">To this point in the chapter we have considered the psychological disorders that fall on Axis I of the <em class="emphasis">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<em class="emphasis">DSM</em>) categorization system. In comparison to the Axis I disorders, which may frequently be severe and dysfunctional and are often brought on by stress, the disorders that fall on Axis II are longer-term disorders that are less likely to be severely incapacitating. Axis II consists primarily of <em class="emphasis">personality disorders</em>. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personality disorder</a><span class="glossdef">A condition characterized by inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, or relating to others that causes problems in personal, social, and work situations.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a disorder characterized by inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, or relating to others that cause problems in personal, social, and work situations</em>. Personality disorders tend to emerge during late childhood or adolescence and usually continue throughout adulthood (Widiger, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_112">Widiger, T.A. (2006). Understanding personality disorders. In S. K. Huprich (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Rorschach assessment to the personality disorders. The LEA series in personality and clinical psychology</em> (pp. 3–25). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span> The disorders can be problematic for the people who have them, but they are less likely to bring people to a therapist for treatment than are Axis I disorders.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p02">The personality disorders are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s05_t01">Table 12.6 "Descriptions of the Personality Disorders (Axis II)"</a>. They are categorized into three types: those characterized by <em class="emphasis">odd or eccentric behavior</em>, those characterized by <em class="emphasis">dramatic or erratic behavior</em>, and those characterized by <em class="emphasis">anxious or inhibited</em> behavior. As you consider the personality types described in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s05_t01">Table 12.6 "Descriptions of the Personality Disorders (Axis II)"</a>, I’m sure you’ll think of people that you know who have each of these traits, at least to some degree. Probably you know someone who seems a bit suspicious and paranoid, who feels that other people are always “ganging up on him,” and who really doesn’t trust other people very much. Perhaps you know someone who fits the bill of being overly dramatic—the “drama queen” who is always raising a stir and whose emotions seem to turn everything into a big deal. Or you might have a friend who is overly dependent on others and can’t seem to get a life of her own.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p03">The personality traits that make up the personality disorders are common—we see them in the people whom we interact with every day—yet they may become problematic when they are rigid, overused, or interfere with everyday behavior (Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_113">Lynam, D., &amp; Widiger, T.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p04">The personality disorders create a bit of a problem for diagnosis. For one, it is frequently difficult for the clinician to accurately diagnose which of the many personality disorders a person has, although the friends and colleagues of the person can generally do a good job of it (Oltmanns &amp; Turkheimer, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_114">Oltmanns, T. F., &amp; Turkheimer, E. (2006). Perceptions of self and others regarding pathological personality traits. In R. F. Krueger &amp; J. L. Tackett (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Personality and psychopathology</em> (pp. 71–111). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> And the personality disorders are highly comorbid; if a person has one, it’s likely that he or she has others as well. Also, the number of people with personality disorders is estimated to be as high as 15% of the population (Grant et al., 2004),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_115">Grant, B., Hasin, D., Stinson, F., Dawson, D., Chou, S., Ruan, W., &amp; Pickering, R.

Prevalence, correlates, and disability of personality disorders in the United States: Results from the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 65</em>(7), 948–958.</span> which might make us wonder if these are really “disorders” in any real sense of the word.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p05">Although they are considered as separate disorders, the personality disorders are essentially milder versions of more severe Axis I disorders (Huang et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_116">Huang, Y., Kotov, R., de Girolamo, G., Preti, A., Angermeyer, M., Benjet, C.,…Kessler, R.

This overlap in classification causes some confusion, and some theorists have argued that the personality disorders should be eliminated from the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em>. But clinicians normally differentiate Axis I and Axis II disorders, and thus the distinction is useful for them (Krueger, 2005; Phillips, Yen, &amp; Gunderson, 2003; Verheul, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_117">Krueger, R.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p06">Although it is not possible to consider the characteristics of each of the personality disorders in this book, let’s focus on two that have important implications for behavior. The first, <em class="emphasis">borderline personality disorder (BPD)</em>, is important because it is so often associated with suicide, and the second, <em class="emphasis">antisocial personality disorder (APD)</em>, because it is the foundation of criminal behavior. Borderline and antisocial personality disorders are also good examples to consider because they are so clearly differentiated in terms of their focus. BPD (more frequently found in women than men) is known as an <em class="emphasis">internalizing disorder</em> because the behaviors that it entails (e.g., suicide and self-mutilation) are mostly directed toward the self. APD (mostly found in men), on the other hand, is a type of <em class="emphasis">externalizing disorder</em> in which the problem behaviors (e.g., lying, fighting, vandalism, and other criminal activity) focus primarily on harm to others.</p>

BPD is widely diagnosed—up to 20% of psychiatric patients are given the diagnosis, and it may occur in up to 2% of the general population (Hyman, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_118">Hyman, S. E. (2002). A new beginning for research on borderline personality disorder. <em class="emphasis">Biological Psychiatry, 51</em>(12), 933–935.</span> About three quarters of diagnosed cases of BDP are women.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p02">People with BPD fear being abandoned by others. They often show a clinging dependency on the other person and engage in manipulation to try to maintain the relationship. They become angry if the other person limits the relationship, but also deny that they care about the person. As a defense against fear of abandonment, borderline people are compulsively social. But their behaviors, including their intense anger, demands, and suspiciousness, repel people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p03">People with BPD often deal with stress by engaging in self-destructive behaviors, for instance by being sexually promiscuous, getting into fights, binge eating and purging, engaging in self-mutilation or drug abuse, and threatening suicide. These behaviors are designed to call forth a “saving” response from the other person. People with BPD are a continuing burden for police, hospitals, and therapists. Borderline individuals also show disturbance in their concepts of identity: They are uncertain about self-image, gender identity, values, loyalties, and goals. They may have chronic feelings of emptiness or boredom and be unable to tolerate being alone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p04">BPD has both genetic as well as environmental roots. In terms of genetics, research has found that those with BPD frequently have neurotransmitter imbalances (Zweig-Frank et al., 2006),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_119">Zweig-Frank, H., Paris, J., Kin, N.

Some theories focus on the development of attachment in early childhood, while others point to parents who fail to provide adequate attention to the child’s feelings. Others focus on parental abuse (both sexual and physical) in adolescence, as well as on divorce, alcoholism, and other stressors (Lobbestael &amp; Arntz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_121">Lobbestael, J., &amp; Arntz, A.

The problems are amplified when the diagnosis is comorbid (as it often is) with other disorders, such as substance abuse disorder, major depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Skodol et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_122">Skodol, A.

Specifically, they hypothesized that the fast emotional pathway through the amygdala is too active, and the slow cognitive-emotional pathway through the prefrontal cortex is not active enough in those with BPD.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p07">The researchers found that while all participants performed the task well, the patients with BPD had more errors than the controls (both in terms of pressing the button when they should not have and not pressing it when they should have).

APD is about three times more likely to be diagnosed in men than in women. To be diagnosed with APD the person must be 18 years of age or older and have a documented history of conduct disorder before the age of 15. People having antisocial personality disorder are sometimes referred to as “sociopaths” or “psychopaths.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s02_p02">People with APD feel little distress for the pain they cause others. They lie, engage in violence against animals and people, and frequently have drug and alcohol abuse problems.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_p01">Although mood, anxiety, and personality disorders represent the most prevalent psychological disorders, as you saw in <a class="xref" href="stangor-ch12_s01#stangor-ch12_s01_s02_t01">Table 12.3 "Categories of Psychological Disorders Based on the "</a> there are a variety of other disorders that affect people. This complexity of symptoms and classifications helps make it clear how difficult it is to accurately and consistently diagnose and treat psychological disorders. In this section we will review three other disorders that are of interest to psychologists and that affect millions of people: <em class="emphasis">somatoform disorder</em>, <em class="emphasis">factitious disorder</em>, and <em class="emphasis">sexual disorder</em>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Somatoform and Factitious Disorders</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p01">Somatoform and factitious disorders both occur in cases where psychological disorders are related to the experience or expression of physical symptoms. The important difference between them is that in somatoform disorders the physical symptoms are real, whereas in factitious disorders they are not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p02">One case in which psychological problems create real physical impairments is in the somatoform disorder known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">somatization disorder (also called Briquet’s syndrome or Brissaud-Marie syndrome)</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder in which a person experiences numerous long-lasting but seemingly unrelated physical ailments that have no identifiable physical cause.</span></span>. Somatization disorder is <em class="emphasis">a psychological disorder in which a person experiences numerous long-lasting but seemingly unrelated physical ailments that have no identifiable physical cause</em>. A person with somatization disorder might complain of joint aches, vomiting, nausea, muscle weakness, as well as sexual dysfunction. The symptoms that result from a somatoform disorder are real and cause distress to the individual, but they are due entirely to psychological factors. The somatoform disorder is more likely to occur when the person is under stress, and it may disappear naturally over time. Somatoform disorder is more common in women than in men, and usually first appears in adolescents or those in their early 20s.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p03">Another type of somatoform disorder is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversion disorder</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder in which patients experience specific neurological symptoms such as numbness, blindness, or paralysis, but where no neurological explanation exists.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a psychological disorder in which patients experience specific neurological symptoms such as numbness, blindness, or paralysis, but where no neurological explanation is observed or possible</em> (Agaki &amp; House, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_128">Akagi, H., &amp; House, A. O. (2001). The epidemiology of hysterical conversion. In P. Halligan, C. Bass, &amp; J. Marshall (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Hysterical conversion: Clinical and theoretical perspectives</em> (pp. 73–87). Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</span> The difference between conversion and somatoform disorders is in terms of the location of the physical complaint. In somatoform disorder the malaise is general, whereas in conversion disorder there are one or several specific neurological symptoms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p04">Conversion disorder gets its name from the idea that the existing psychological disorder is “converted” into the physical symptoms. It was the observation of conversion disorder (then known as “hysteria”) that first led Sigmund Freud to become interested in the psychological aspects of illness in his work with Jean-Martin Charcot. Conversion disorder is not common (a prevalence of less than 1%), but it may in many cases be undiagnosed. Conversion disorder occurs twice or more frequently in women than in men.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p05">There are two somatoform disorders that involve preoccupations. We have seen an example of one of them, <em class="emphasis">body dysmorphic disorder</em>, in the <a class="xref" href="stangor-ch12#stangor-ch12">Chapter 12 "Defining Psychological Disorders"</a> opener. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychological disorder accompanied by an imagined or exaggerated defect in body parts or body odor. There are no sex differences in prevalence, but men are most often obsessed with their body build, their genitals, and hair loss, whereas women are more often obsessed with their breasts and body shape. BDD usually begins in adolescence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hypochondriasis (hypochondria)</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder accompanied by excessive worry about having a serious illness.</span></span> is another <em class="emphasis">psychological disorder that is focused on preoccupation, accompanied by excessive worry about having a serious illness</em>. The patient often misinterprets normal body symptoms such as coughing, perspiring, headaches, or a rapid heartbeat as signs of serious illness, and the patient’s concerns remain even after he or she has been medically evaluated and assured that the health concerns are unfounded. Many people with hypochondriasis focus on a particular symptom such as stomach problems or heart palpitations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p07">Two other psychological disorders relate to the experience of physical problems that are not real. Patients with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">factitious disorder</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder in which participants fake physical symptoms in large part because they enjoy the attention and treatment that they receive in the hospital.</span></span> fake physical symptoms in large part because they enjoy the attention and treatment that they receive in the hospital. They may lie about symptoms, alter diagnostic tests such as urine samples to mimic disease, or even injure themselves to bring on more symptoms. In the more severe form of factitious disorder known as <em class="emphasis">Münchausen syndrome</em>, the patient has a lifelong pattern of a series of successive hospitalizations for faked symptoms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p08">Factitious disorder is distinguished from another related disorder known as <em class="emphasis">malingering</em>, which also involves fabricating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders, but where the motivation for doing so is to gain financial reward; to avoid school, work, or military service; to obtain drugs; or to avoid prosecution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p09">The somatoform disorders are almost always comorbid with other psychological disorders, including anxiety and depression and dissociative states (Smith et al., 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_129">Smith, R. C., Gardiner, J. C., Lyles, J. S., Sirbu, C., Dwamena, F. C., Hodges, A.,…Goddeeris, J. (2005).

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s01_p10">Somatoform and factitious disorders are problematic not only for the patient, but they also have societal costs. People with these disorders frequently follow through with potentially dangerous medical tests and are at risk for drug addiction from the drugs they are given and for injury from the complications of the operations they submit to (Bass, Peveler, &amp; House, 2001; Looper &amp; Kirmayer, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_130">Bass, C., Peveler, R., &amp; House, A.

To help combat these costs, emergency room and hospital workers use a variety of tests for detecting these disorders.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">Hypoactive sexual desire disorder</em>, one of the most common sexual dysfunctions, refers to a persistently low or nonexistent sexual desire. How “low sexual desire” is defined, however, is problematic because it depends on the person’s sex and age, on cultural norms, as well as on the relative desires of the individual and the partner. Again, the importance of dysfunction and distress is critical. If neither partner is much interested in sex, for instance, the lack of interest may not cause a problem. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is often comorbid with other psychological disorders, including mood disorders and problems with sexual arousal or sexual pain (Donahey &amp; Carroll, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_132">Donahey, K.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">Sexual aversion disorder</em> refers to an avoidance of sexual behavior caused by disgust or aversion to genital contact. The aversion may be a phobic reaction to an early sexual experience or sexual abuse, a misattribution of negative emotions to sex that are actually caused by something else, or a reaction to a sexual problem such as erectile dysfunction (Kingsberg &amp; Janata, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_133">Kingsberg, S.

Althof (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of clinical sexuality for mental health professionals</em> (pp. 153–165). New York, NY: Brunner-Routledge.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Female sexual arousal disorder</em> refers to persistent difficulties becoming sexually aroused or sufficiently lubricated in response to sexual stimulation in women. The disorder may be comorbid with hypoactive sexual desire or orgasmic disorder, or mood or anxiety disorders.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p05"><em class="emphasis">Male erectile disorder</em> (sometimes referred to as “impotence”) refers to persistent and dysfunctional difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection sufficient to complete sexual activity. Prevalence rates vary by age, from about 6% of college-aged males to 35% of men in their 70s. About half the men aged 40 to 70 report having problems getting or maintaining an erection “now and then.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p06">Most erectile dysfunction occurs as a result of physiological factors, including illness, and the use of medications, alcohol, or other recreational drugs. Erectile dysfunction is also related to anxiety, low self-esteem, and general problems in the particular relationship. Assessment for physiological causes of erectile dysfunction is made using a test in which a device is attached to the man’s penis before he goes to sleep. During the night the man may have an erection, and if he does the device records its occurrence. If the man has erections while sleeping, this provides assurance that the problem is not physiological.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p07">One of the most common sexual dysfunctions in men is <em class="emphasis">premature ejaculation</em>. It is not possible to exactly specify what defines “premature,” but if the man ejaculates before or immediately upon insertion of the penis into the vagina, most clinicians will identify the response as premature. Most men diagnosed with premature ejaculation ejaculate within one minute after insertion (Waldinger, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_134">Waldinger, M. D. (2003). Rapid ejaculation. In S. B. Levine, C. B. Risen, &amp; S. E. Althof (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of clinical sexuality for mental health professionals</em> (pp. 257–274). New York, NY: Brunner-Routledge.</span> Premature ejaculation is one of the most prevalent sexual disorders and causes much anxiety in many men.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p08"><em class="emphasis">Female orgasmic disorder</em> refers to the inability to obtain orgasm in women. The woman enjoys sex and foreplay and shows normal signs of sexual arousal but cannot reach the peak experience of orgasm. <em class="emphasis">Male orgasmic disorder</em> includes a delayed or retarded ejaculation (very rare) or (more commonly) premature ejaculation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p09">Finally, <em class="emphasis">dyspareunia</em> and <em class="emphasis">vaginismus</em> refer to sexual pain disorders that create pain and involuntary spasms, respectively, in women, and thus make it painful to have sex. In most cases these problems are biological and can be treated with hormones, creams, or surgery.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p10">Sexual dysfunctions have a variety of causes. In some cases the primary problem is biological, and the disorder may be treated with medication. Other causes include a repressive upbringing in which the parents have taught the person that sex is dirty or sinful, or the experience of sexual abuse (Beitchman, Zucker, Hood, &amp; DaCosta, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_135">Beitchman, J. H., Zucker, K. J., Hood, J. E., &amp; DaCosta, G. A. (1992). A review of the long-term effects of child sexual abuse. <em class="emphasis">Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, 16</em>(1), 101–118.</span> In some cases the sex problem may be due to the fact that the person has a different sexual orientation than he or she is engaging in. Other problems include poor communication between the partners, a lack of sexual skills, and (particularly for men) performance anxiety.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s01_p11">It is important to remember that most sexual disorders are temporary—they are experienced for a period of time, in certain situations or with certain partners, and then (without, or if necessary with, the help of therapy) go away. It is also important to remember that there are a wide variety of sex acts that are enjoyable. Couples with happy sex lives work together to find ways that work best for their own styles. Sexual problems often develop when the partners do not communicate well with each other, and are reduced when they do.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s02_p02">Gender identity disorder is rare, occurring only in about 1 in every 12,000 males and 1 in every 30,000 females (Olsson &amp; Möller, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_137">Olsson, S.-E., &amp; Möller, A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s02_p03">The classification of GID as a mental disorder has been challenged because people who suffer from GID do not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder and do not feel that they are distressed or dysfunctional. People suffering from GID often argue that a “normal” gender identity may not necessarily involve an identification with one’s own biological sex. GID represents another example, then, of how culture defines disorder, and the next edition of the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> may change the categorizations used in this domain accordingly.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s06_s02_s03_p02">People with paraphilias are usually rejected by society but for two different reasons. In some cases, such as <em class="emphasis">voyeurism</em> and <em class="emphasis">pedophilia</em>, the behavior is unacceptable (and illegal) because it involves a lack of consent on the part of the recipient of the sexual advance. But other paraphilias are rejected simply because they are unusual, even though they are consensual and do not cause distress or dysfunction to the partners. <em class="emphasis">Sexual sadism</em> and <em class="emphasis">sexual masochism</em>, for instance, are usually practiced consensually, and thus may not be harmful to the partners or to society. A recent survey found that individuals who engage in sadism and masochism are as psychologically healthy as those who do not (Connolly, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_139">Connolly, P. (2006). Psychological functioning of bondage/domination/sado-masochism (BDSM) practitioners. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality, 18</em>(1), 79–120. doi:10.1300/j056v18n01_05</span> Again, as cultural norms about the appropriateness of behaviors change, the new revision of the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em>, due in 2013, will likely change its classification system of these behaviors.</p>

                    <li>Somatoform disorders, including body dysmorphic disorder and hypochondriasis, occur when people become excessively and inaccurately preoccupied with the potential that they have an illness or stigma.</li>
                    <li>Patients with factitious disorder fake physical symptoms in large part because they enjoy the attention and treatment that they receive in the hospital. In the more severe form of factitious disorder known as Münchhausen syndrome, the patient has a lifelong pattern with a series of successive hospitalizations for faked symptoms.</li>
                    <li>Sexual dysfunction is a psychological disorder that occurs when the physical sexual response cycle is inadequate for reproduction or for sexual enjoyment. The types of problems experienced are different for men and women. Many sexual dysfunctions are only temporary or can be treated with therapy or medication.</li>
                    <li>Gender identity disorder (GID, also called transsexualism) is a rare disorder that is diagnosed when the individual displays a repeated and strong desire to be the other sex, a persistent discomfort with one’s sex, and a belief that one was born the wrong sex, accompanied by significant dysfunction and distress.</li>
                    <li>The classification of GID as a mental disorder has been challenged because people who suffer from it do not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder and do not feel that they are distressed or dysfunctional.</li>
                    <li>A paraphilia is a sexual deviation where sexual arousal is obtained from a consistent pattern of inappropriate responses to objects or people, and in which the behaviors associated with the feelings are distressing and dysfunctional. Some paraphilias are illegal because they involve a lack of consent on the part of the recipient of the sexual advance, but other paraphilias are simply unusual, even though they may not cause distress or dysfunction.</li>

<span class="title-prefix">12.7</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p01">More psychologists are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorder than in any other aspect of psychology.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p02">About 1 in every 4 Americans (over 78 million people) are estimated to be affected by a psychological disorder during any one year. The impact of mental illness is particularly strong on people who are poorer, of lower socioeconomic class, and from disadvantaged ethnic groups.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p03">A psychological disorder is an unusual, distressing, and dysfunctional pattern of thought, emotion, or behavior. Psychological disorders are often comorbid, meaning that a given person suffers from more than one disorder.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p04">The stigma of mental disorder affects people while they are ill, while they are healing, and even after they have healed. But mental illness is not a “fault,” and it is important to work to help overcome the stigma associated with disorder.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p05">All psychological disorders are multiply determined by biological, psychological, and social factors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p06">Psychologists diagnose disorder using the <em class="emphasis">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<em class="emphasis">DSM</em>). The <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> organizes the diagnosis of disorder according to five dimensions (or axes) relating to different aspects of disorder or disability. The <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> uses categories, and patients with close approximations to the prototype are said to have that disorder.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p07">One critique of the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> is that many disorders—for instance, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autistic disorder, and Asperger’s disorder—are being diagnosed significantly more frequently than they were in the past.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p08">Anxiety disorders are psychological disturbances marked by irrational fears, often of everyday objects and situations. They include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety disorders affect about 57 million Americans every year.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p09">Dissociative disorders are conditions that involve disruptions or breakdowns of memory, awareness, and identity. They include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, and dissociative identity disorder.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p10">Mood disorders are psychological disorders in which the person’s mood negatively influences his or her physical, perceptual, social, and cognitive processes. They include dysthymia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Mood disorders affect about 30 million Americans every year.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p11">Schizophrenia is a serious psychological disorder marked by delusions, hallucinations, loss of contact with reality, inappropriate affect, disorganized speech, social withdrawal, and deterioration of adaptive behavior. About 3 million Americans have schizophrenia.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p12">A personality disorder is a long-lasting but frequently less severe disorder characterized by inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, or relating to others that causes problems in personal, social, and work situations. They are characterized by odd or eccentric behavior, by dramatic or erratic behavior, or by anxious or inhibited behavior. Two of the most important personality disorders are borderline personality disorder (BPD) and antisocial personality disorder (APD).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p13">Somatization disorder is a psychological disorder in which a person experiences numerous long-lasting but seemingly unrelated physical ailments that have no identifiable physical cause. Somatization disorders include conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and hypochondriasis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p14">Patients with factitious disorder fake physical symptoms in large part because they enjoy the attention and treatment that they receive in the hospital.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p15">Sexual disorders refer to a variety of problems revolving around performing or enjoying sex. Sexual dysfunctions include problems relating to loss of sexual desire, sexual response or orgasm, and pain during sex.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p16">Gender identity disorder (GID, also called transsexualism) is diagnosed when the individual displays a repeated and strong desire to be the other sex, a persistent discomfort with one’s sex, and a belief that one was born the wrong sex, accompanied by significant dysfunction and distress. The classification of GID as a mental disorder has been challenged because people who suffer from GID do not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder and do not feel that they are distressed or dysfunctional.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s07_p17">A paraphilia is a sexual deviation where sexual arousal is obtained from a consistent pattern of inappropriate responses to objects or people, and in which the behaviors associated with the feelings are distressing and dysfunctional.</p>
