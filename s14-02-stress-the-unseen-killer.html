        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s01_p03">The initial arousal that accompanies stress is normally quite adaptive because it helps us respond to potentially dangerous events. The experience of prolonged stress, however, has a direct negative influence on our physical health, because at the same time that stress increases activity in the sympathetic division of the ANS, it also suppresses activity in the parasympathetic division of the ANS. When stress is long-term, the HPA axis remains active and the adrenals continue to produce cortisol. This increased cortisol production exhausts the stress mechanism, leading to fatigue and depression.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s01_p04">The HPA reactions to persistent stress lead to a weakening of the immune system, making us more susceptible to a variety of health problems including colds and other diseases (Cohen &amp; Herbert, 1996; Faulkner &amp; Smith, 2009; Miller, Chen, &amp; Cole, 2009; Uchino, Smith, Holt-Lunstad, Campo, &amp; Reblin, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_028">Cohen, S., &amp; Herbert, T.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s01_p05">Chronic stress is also a major contributor to heart disease. Although heart disease is caused in part by genetic factors, as well as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cigarette smoking, it is also caused by stress (Krantz &amp; McCeney, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_031">Krantz, D.

Stress increases cardiac output (i.e., the heart pumps more blood) at the same time that it reduces the ability of the blood vessels to conduct blood through the arteries, as the increase in levels of cortisol leads to a buildup of plaque on artery walls (Dekker et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_032">Dekker, M., Koper, J., van Aken, M., Pols, H., Hofman, A., de Jong, F.,…Tiemeier, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s02_p01">The stressors for Seyle’s rats included electric shock and exposure to cold. Although these are probably not on your top-10 list of most common stressors, the stress that you experience in your everyday life can also be taxing.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Responses to Stress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Not all people experience and respond to stress in the same way, and these differences can be important. The cardiologists Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman (1974)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_039">Friedman, M., &amp; Rosenman, R. H. (1974). <em class="emphasis">Type A behavior and your heart</em>. New York, NY: Knopf.</span> were among the first to study the link between stress and heart disease. In their research they noticed that even though the partners in married couples often had similar lifestyles, diet, and exercise patterns, the husbands nevertheless generally had more heart disease than did the wives. As they tried to explain the difference, they focused on the personality characteristics of the partners, finding that the husbands were more likely than the wives to respond to stressors with negative emotions and hostility.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p02">Recent research has shown that the strongest predictor of a physiological stress response from daily hassles is the amount of negative emotion that they evoke. People who experience strong negative emotions as a result of everyday hassles, and who respond to stress with hostility experience more negative health outcomes than do those who react in a less negative way (McIntyre, Korn, &amp; Matsuo, 2008; Suls &amp; Bunde, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_040">McIntyre, K., Korn, J., &amp; Matsuo, H.

Singer (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of health psychology</em>. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span> found that people who scored high on measures of anger were three times more likely to suffer from heart attacks in comparison to those who scored lower on anger.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p03">On average, men are more likely than are women to respond to stress by activating the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fight-or-flight response</a><span class="glossdef">An emotional and behavioral reaction to stress that increases the readiness for action.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">an emotional and behavioral reaction to stress that increases the readiness for action</em>. The arousal that men experience when they are stressed leads them to either go on the attack, in an aggressive or revenging way, or else retreat as quickly as they can to safety from the stressor. The fight-or-flight response allows men to control the source of the stress if they think they can do so, or if that is not possible, it allows them to save face by leaving the situation. The fight-or-flight response is triggered in men by the activation of the HPA axis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p04">Women, on the other hand, are less likely to take a fight-or-flight response to stress. Rather, they are more likely to take a <em class="emphasis">tend-and-befriend response</em> (Taylor et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_042">Taylor, S. E., Klein, L.

This approach is also self-protective because it allows the individual to talk to others about her concerns, as well as to exchange resources, such as child care. The tend-and-befriend response is triggered in women by the release of the hormone <em class="emphasis">ocytocin</em>, which promotes affiliation. Overall, the tend-and-befriend response is healthier than the flight-or-flight response because it does not produce the elevated levels of arousal related to the HPA, including the negative results that accompany increased levels of cortisol. This may help explain why women, on average, have less heart disease and live longer than men.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Stress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p01">No matter how healthy and happy we are in our everyday lives, there are going to be times when we experience stress. But we do not need to throw up our hands in despair when things go wrong; rather, we can use our personal and social resources to help us.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p02">Perhaps the most common approach to dealing with negative affect is to attempt to suppress, avoid, or deny it. You probably know people who seem to be stressed, depressed, or anxious, but they cannot or will not see it in themselves. Perhaps you tried to talk to them about it, to get them to open up to you, but were rebuffed. They seem to act as if there is no problem at all, simply moving on with life without admitting or even trying to deal with the negative feelings. Or perhaps you have even taken a similar approach yourself. Have you ever had an important test to study for or an important job interview coming up, and rather than planning and preparing for it, you simply tried put it out of your mind entirely?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p03">Research has found that ignoring stress is not a good approach for coping with it. For one, ignoring our problems does not make them go away. If we experience so much stress that we get sick, these events will be detrimental to our life even if we do not or cannot admit that they are occurring. Suppressing our negative emotions is also not a very good option, at least in the long run, because it tends to fail (Gross &amp; Levenson, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_043">Gross, J. J., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1997). Hiding feelings: The acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 106</em>(1), 95–103.</span> For one, if we know that we have that big exam coming up, we have to focus on the exam itself to suppress it. We can’t really suppress or deny our thoughts, because we actually have to recall and face the event to make the attempt to not think about it. Doing so takes effort, and we get tired when we try to do it. Furthermore, we may continually worry that our attempts to suppress will fail. Suppressing our emotions might work out for a short while, but when we run out of energy the negative emotions may shoot back up into consciousness, causing us to reexperience the negative feelings that we had been trying to avoid.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p04">Daniel Wegner and his colleagues (Wegner, Schneider, Carter, &amp; White, 1987)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_044">Wegner, D. M., Schneider, D. J., Carter, S. R., &amp; White, T. L. (1987). Paradoxical effects of thought suppression. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53</em>(1), 5–13.</span> directly tested whether people would be able to effectively suppress a simple thought. He asked them to <em class="emphasis">not</em> think about a white bear for 5 minutes but to ring a bell in case they did. (Try it yourself; can you do it?) However, participants were unable to suppress the thought as instructed. The white bear kept popping into mind, even when the participants were instructed to avoid thinking about it. You might have had this experience when you were dieting or trying to study rather than party; the chocolate bar in the kitchen cabinet and the fun time you were missing at the party kept popping into mind, disrupting your work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p05">Suppressing our negative thoughts does not work, and there is evidence that the opposite is true: When we are faced with troubles, it is healthy to let out the negative thoughts and feelings by expressing them, either to ourselves or to others. James Pennebaker and his colleagues (Pennebaker, Colder, &amp; Sharp, 1990; Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_045">Pennebaker, J.

(1989). Health complaints, stress, and distress: Exploring the central role of negative affectivity. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 96</em>(2), 234–254.</span> have conducted many correlational and experimental studies that demonstrate the advantages to our mental and physical health of opening up versus suppressing our feelings. This research team has found that simply talking about or writing about our emotions or our reactions to negative events provides substantial health benefits. For instance, Pennebaker and Beall (1986)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_046">Pennebaker, J. W., &amp; Beall, S. K. (1986). Confronting a traumatic event: Toward an understanding of inhibition and disease. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 95</em>(3), 274–281.</span> randomly assigned students to write about either the most traumatic and stressful event of their lives or trivial topics. Although the students who wrote about the traumas had higher blood pressure and more negative moods immediately after they wrote their essays, they were also less likely to visit the student health center for illnesses during the following six months. Other research studied individuals whose spouses had died in the previous year, finding that the more they talked about the death with others, the less likely they were to become ill during the subsequent year. Daily writing about one’s emotional states has also been found to increase immune system functioning (Petrie, Fontanilla, Thomas, Booth, &amp; Pennebaker, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_047">Petrie, K.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p06">Opening up probably helps in various ways. For one, expressing our problems to others allows us to gain information, and possibly support, from them (remember the <em class="emphasis">tend-and-befriend response</em> that is so effectively used to reduce stress by women). Writing or thinking about one’s experiences also seems to help people make sense of these events and may give them a feeling of control over their lives (Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_048">Pennebaker, J. W., &amp; Stone, L. D. (Eds.). (2004). <em class="emphasis">Translating traumatic experiences into language: Implications for child abuse and long-term health</em>. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p07">It is easier to respond to stress if we can interpret it in more positive ways. Kelsey et al. (1999)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_049">Kelsey, R. M., Blascovich, J., Tomaka, J., Leitten, C. L., Schneider, T. R., &amp; Wiens, S. (1999). Cardiovascular reactivity and adaptation to recurrent psychological stress: Effects of prior task exposure. <em class="emphasis">Psychophysiology, 36</em>(6), 818–831.</span> found that some people interpret stress as a challenge (something that they feel that they can, with effort, deal with), whereas others see the same stress as a threat (something that is negative and fearful). People who viewed stress as a challenge had fewer physiological stress responses than those who viewed it as a threat—they were able to frame and react to stress in more positive ways.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Emotion Regulation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p01">Emotional responses such as the stress reaction are useful in warning us about potential danger and in mobilizing our response to it, so it is a good thing that we have them. However, we also need to learn how to control our emotions, to prevent them from letting our behavior get out of control. <em class="emphasis">The ability to successfully control our emotions</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotion regulation</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to successfully control our emotions.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p02">Emotion regulation has some important positive outcomes. Consider, for instance, research by Walter Mischel and his colleagues. In their studies, they had 4- and 5-year-old children sit at a table in front of a yummy snack, such as a chocolate chip cookie or a marshmallow. The children were told that they could eat the snack right away if they wanted. However, they were also told that if they could wait for just a couple of minutes, they’d be able to have two snacks—both the one in front of them and another just like it. However, if they ate the one that was in front of them before the time was up, they would not get a second.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p03">Mischel found that some children were able to override the impulse to seek immediate gratification to obtain a greater reward at a later time. Other children, of course, were not; they just ate the first snack right away. Furthermore, the inability to delay gratification seemed to occur in a spontaneous and emotional manner, without much thought. The children who could not resist simply grabbed the cookie because it looked so yummy, without being able to stop themselves (Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999; Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_050">Metcalfe, J., &amp; Mischel, W.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p04">The ability to regulate our emotions has important consequences later in life. When Mischel followed up on the children in his original study, he found that those who had been able to self-regulate grew up to have some highly positive characteristics: They got better SAT scores, were rated by their friends as more socially adept, and were found to cope with frustration and stress better than those children who could not resist the tempting cookie at a young age. Thus effective self-regulation can be recognized as an important key to success in life (Ayduk et al., 2000; Eigsti et al., 2006; Mischel &amp; Ayduk, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_051">Ayduk, O., Mendoza-Denton, R., Mischel, W., Downey, G., Peake, P.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p06">Emotion regulation is particularly difficult when we are tired, depressed, or anxious, and it is under these conditions that we more easily let our emotions get the best of us (Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_054">Muraven, M., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (2000). Self-regulation and depletion of limited resources: Does self-control resemble a muscle? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 126</em>(2), 247–259.</span> If you are tired and worried about an upcoming exam, you may find yourself getting angry and taking it out on your roommate, even though she really hasn’t done anything to deserve it and you don’t really want to be angry at her. It is no secret that we are more likely fail at our diets when we are under a lot of stress, or at night when we are tired.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p07">Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister (1998)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_055">Muraven, M., Tice, D. M., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (1998). Self-control as a limited resource: Regulatory depletion patterns. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 74</em>(3), 774–789.</span> conducted a study to demonstrate that emotion regulation—that is, either increasing or decreasing our emotional responses—takes work. They speculated that self-control was like a muscle; it just gets tired when it is used too much. In their experiment they asked their participants to watch a short movie about environmental disasters involving radioactive waste and their negative effects on wildlife. The scenes included sick and dying animals and were very upsetting. According to random assignment to condition, one group (the <em class="emphasis">increase emotional response</em> condition) was told to really get into the movie and to express their emotions, one group was to hold back and decrease their emotional responses (the <em class="emphasis">decrease emotional response</em> condition), and the third (<em class="emphasis">control</em>) group received no emotional regulation instructions.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p08">Both before and after the movie, the experimenter asked the participants to engage in a measure of physical strength by squeezing as hard as they could on a handgrip exerciser, a device used for strengthening hand muscles. The experimenter put a piece of paper in the grip and timed how long the participants could hold the grip together before the paper fell out. <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s02_s05_f01">Figure 10.10 "Results From Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998"</a> shows the results of this study. It seems that emotion regulation does indeed take effort, because the participants who had been asked to control their emotions showed significantly less ability to squeeze the handgrip after the movie than they had showed before it, whereas the control group showed virtually no decrease. The emotion regulation during the movie seems to have consumed resources, leaving the participants with less capacity to perform the handgrip task.</p>

                <li>Stress refers to the physiological responses that occur when an organism fails to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats.</li>
                <li>The general adaptation syndrome refers to the three distinct phases of physiological change that occur in response to long-term stress: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.</li>
                <li>Stress is normally adaptive because it helps us respond to potentially dangerous events by activating the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. But the experience of prolonged stress has a direct negative influence on our physical health.</li>
                <li>Chronic stress is a major contributor to heart disease. It also decreases our ability to fight off colds and infections.</li>
                <li>Stressors can occur as a result of both major and minor everyday events.</li>
                <li>Men tend to respond to stress with the fight-or-flight response, whereas women are more likely to take a tend-and-befriend response.</li>
