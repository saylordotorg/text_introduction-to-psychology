<span class="title-prefix">4.6</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p01">Sensation and perception work seamlessly together to allow us to detect both the presence of, and changes in, the stimuli around us.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p02">The study of sensation and perception is exceedingly important for our everyday lives because the knowledge generated by psychologists is used in so many ways to help so many people.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p03">Each sense accomplishes the basic process of transduction—the conversion of stimuli detected by receptor cells into electrical impulses that are then transported to the brain—in different, but related, ways.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p04">Psychophysics is the branch of psychology that studies the effects of physical stimuli on sensory perceptions. Psychophysicists study the absolute threshold of sensation as well as the difference threshold, or just noticeable difference (JND). Weber’s law maintains that the JND of a stimulus is a constant proportion of the original intensity of the stimulus.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p05">Most of our cerebral cortex is devoted to seeing, and we have substantial visual skills. The eye is a specialized system that includes the cornea, pupil, iris, lens, and retina. Neurons, including rods and cones, react to light landing on the retina and send it to the visual cortex via the optic nerve.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p06">Images are perceived, in part, through the action of feature detector neurons.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p07">The shade of a color, known as hue, is conveyed by the wavelength of the light that enters the eye. The Young-Helmholtz trichromatic color theory and the opponent-process color theory are theories of how the brain perceives color.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p08">Depth is perceived using both binocular and monocular depth cues. Monocular depth cues are based on gestalt principles. The beta effect and the phi phenomenon are important in detecting motion.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p09">The ear detects both the amplitude (loudness) and frequency (pitch) of sound waves.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p10">Important structures of the ear include the pinna, eardrum, ossicles, cochlea, and the oval window.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p11">The frequency theory of hearing proposes that as the pitch of a sound wave increases, nerve impulses of a corresponding frequency are sent to the auditory nerve. The place theory of hearing proposes that different areas of the cochlea respond to different frequencies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p12">Sounds that are 85 decibels or more can cause damage to your hearing, particularly if you are exposed to them repeatedly. Sounds that exceed 130 decibels are dangerous, even if you are exposed to them infrequently.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p13">The tongue detects six different taste sensations, known respectively as sweet, salty, sour, bitter, piquancy (spicy), and umami (savory).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p14">We have approximately 1,000 types of odor receptor cells and it is estimated that we can detect 10,000 different odors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p15">Thousands of nerve endings in the skin respond to four basic sensations: Pressure, hot, cold, and pain, but only the sensation of pressure has its own specialized receptors. The ability to keep track of where the body is moving is provided by the vestibular system.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p16">Perception involves the processes of sensory interaction, selective attention, sensory adaptation, and perceptual constancy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p17">Although our perception is very accurate, it is not perfect. Our expectations and emotions color our perceptions and may result in illusions.</p>
