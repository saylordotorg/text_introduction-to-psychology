        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s01_p04">People suffering from schizophrenia also often suffer from the positive symptom of <em class="emphasis">derailment</em>—the shifting from one subject to another, without following any one line of thought to conclusion—and may exhibit <em class="emphasis">grossly disorganized behavior</em> including inappropriate sexual behavior, peculiar appearance and dress, unusual agitation (e.g., shouting and swearing), strange body movements, and awkward facial expressions. It is also common for schizophrenia sufferers to experience <em class="emphasis">inappropriate affect</em>. For example, a patient may laugh uncontrollably when hearing sad news. Movement disorders typically appear as agitated movements, such as repeating a certain motion again and again, but can in some cases include <em class="emphasis">catatonia</em>, a state in which a person does not move and is unresponsive to others (Janno, Holi, Tuisku, &amp; Wahlbeck, 2004; Rosebush &amp; Mazurek, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_095">Janno, S., Holi, M., Tuisku, K., &amp; Wahlbeck, K.

Negative symptoms in schizophrenia(s): The conceptual basis. <em class="emphasis">Harvard Brain, 7</em>, 7–10.</span> Patients often suffer from flat affect, which means that they express almost no emotional response (e.g., they speak in a monotone and have a blank facial expression) even though they may report feeling emotions (Kring, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_097">Kring, A. M. (1999). Emotion in schizophrenia: Old mystery, new understanding. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 8</em>, 160–163.</span> Another negative symptom is the tendency toward incoherent language, for instance, to repeat the speech of others (“echo speech”). Some schizophrenics experience motor disturbances, ranging from complete catatonia and apparent obliviousness to their environment to random and frenzied motor activity during which they become hyperactive and incoherent (Kirkpatrick &amp; Tek, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_098">Kirkpatrick, B., &amp; Tek, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p03">Neuroimaging studies have found some differences in brain structure between schizophrenic and normal patients. In some people with schizophrenia, the cerebral ventricles (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) are enlarged (Suddath, Christison, Torrey, Casanova, &amp; Weinberger, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_102">Suddath, R.

This would explain the deterioration of functioning in language and thought processing that is commonly experienced by schizophrenic patients (Galderisi et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_103">Galderisi, S., Quarantelli, M., Volper, U., Mucci, A., Cassano, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p04">Many researchers believe that schizophrenia is caused in part by excess dopamine, and this theory is supported by the fact that most of the drugs useful in treating schizophrenia inhibit dopamine activity in the brain (Javitt &amp; Laruelle, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_104">Javitt, D.

It also remains unclear whether observed differences in the neurotransmitter systems of people with schizophrenia cause the disease, or if they are the result of the disease itself or its treatment (Csernansky &amp; Grace, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_106">Csernansky, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p06">One hypothesis is that schizophrenia is caused in part by disruptions to normal brain development in infancy that may be caused by poverty, malnutrition, and disease (Brown et al., 2004; Murray &amp; Bramon, 2005; Susser et al., 1996; Waddington, Lane, Larkin, O’Callaghan, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_108">Brown, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s04_s02_p07">Another social factor that has been found to be important in schizophrenia is the degree to which one or more of the patient’s relatives is highly critical or highly emotional in their attitude toward the patient.

Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</span> found that schizophrenic patients who ended a stay in a hospital and returned to a family with high expressed emotion were three times more likely to relapse than patients who returned to a family with low expressed emotion. It may be that the families with high expressed emotion are a source of stress to the patient.</p>

                <li>Schizophrenia is a serious psychological disorder marked by delusions, hallucinations, and loss of contact with reality.</li>
                <li>Schizophrenia is accompanied by a variety of symptoms, but not all patients have all of them.</li>
                <li>Because the schizophrenic patient has lost contact with reality, we say that he or she is experiencing psychosis.</li>
                <li>Positive symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, derailment, disorganized behavior, inappropriate affect, and catatonia.</li>
                <li>Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include social withdrawal, poor hygiene and grooming, poor problem-solving abilities, and a distorted sense of time.</li>
                <li>Cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia include difficulty comprehending and using information and problems maintaining focus.</li>
                <li>There is no single cause of schizophrenia. Rather, there are a variety of biological and environmental risk factors that interact in a complex way to increase the likelihood that someone might develop schizophrenia.</li>
