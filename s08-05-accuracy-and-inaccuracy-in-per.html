    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_p01">The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin sense the world around us, and in some cases perform preliminary information processing on the incoming data. But by and large, we do not experience sensation—we experience the outcome of perception—the total package that the brain puts together from the pieces it receives through our senses and that the brain creates for us to experience. When we look out the window at a view of the countryside, or when we look at the face of a good friend, we don’t just see a jumble of colors and shapes—we see, instead, an image of a countryside or an image of a friend (Goodale &amp; Milner, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_043">Goodale, M., &amp; Milner, D.

One example of sensory interaction is shown in the <em class="emphasis">McGurk effect</em>—an error in perception that occurs when we misperceive sounds because the audio and visual parts of the speech are mismatched.

Most people do not experience synesthesia, but those who do link their perceptions in unusual ways, for instance, by experiencing color when they taste a particular food or by hearing sounds when they see certain objects (Ramachandran, Hubbard, Robertson, &amp; Sagiv, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_045">Ramachandran, V.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p05">Selective attention also allows us to focus on a single talker at a party while ignoring other conversations that are occurring around us (Broadbent, 1958; Cherry, 1953).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_047">Broadbent, D. E. (1958). <em class="emphasis">Perception and communication</em>. New York, NY: Pergamon; Cherry, E. C. (1953). Some experiments on the recognition of speech, with one and with two ears. <em class="emphasis">Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>, 25, 975–979.</span> Without this automatic selective attention, we’d be unable to focus on the single conversation we want to hear. But selective attention is not complete; we also at the same time monitor what’s happening in the channels we are not focusing on. Perhaps you have had the experience of being at a party and talking to someone in one part of the room, when suddenly you hear your name being mentioned by someone in another part of the room. This <em class="emphasis">cocktail party phenomenon</em> shows us that although selective attention is limiting what we processes, we are nevertheless at the same time doing a lot of unconscious monitoring of the world around us—you didn’t know you were attending to the background sounds of the party, but evidently you were.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p06">A second fundamental process of perception is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sensory adaptation</a><span class="glossdef">A decreased sensitivity to a stimulus after prolonged and constant exposure.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a decreased sensitivity to a stimulus after prolonged and constant exposure</em>. When you step into a swimming pool, the water initially feels cold, but after a while you stop noticing it. After prolonged exposure to the same stimulus, our sensitivity toward it diminishes and we no longer perceive it. The ability to adapt to the things that don’t change around us is essential to our survival, as it leaves our sensory receptors free to detect the important and informative changes in our environment and to respond accordingly. We ignore the sounds that our car makes every day, which leaves us free to pay attention to the sounds that are different from normal, and thus likely to need our attention. Our sensory receptors are alert to novelty and are fatigued after constant exposure to the same stimulus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p07">If sensory adaptation occurs with all senses, why doesn’t an image fade away after we stare at it for a period of time? The answer is that, although we are not aware of it, our eyes are constantly flitting from one angle to the next, making thousands of tiny movements (called <em class="emphasis">saccades</em>) every minute. This constant eye movement guarantees that the image we are viewing always falls on fresh receptor cells. What would happen if we could stop the movement of our eyes? Psychologists have devised a way of testing the sensory adaptation of the eye by attaching an instrument that ensures a constant image is maintained on the eye’s inner surface. Participants are fitted with a contact lens that has miniature slide projector attached to it. Because the projector follows the exact movements of the eye, the same image is always projected, stimulating the same spot, on the retina. Within a few seconds, interesting things begin to happen. The image will begin to vanish, then reappear, only to disappear again, either in pieces or as a whole. Even the eye experiences sensory adaptation (Yarbus, 1967).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_048">Yarbus, A. L. (1967). <em class="emphasis">Eye movements and vision</em>. New York, NY: Plenum Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p08">One of the major problems in perception is to ensure that we always perceive the same object in the same way, despite the fact that the sensations that it creates on our receptors changes dramatically. <em class="emphasis">The ability to perceive a stimulus as constant despite changes in sensation</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perceptual constancy</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to perceive a stimulus as constant despite changes in sensation.</span></span>. Consider our image of a door as it swings. When it is closed, we see it as rectangular, but when it is open, we see only its edge and it appears as a line. But we never perceive the door as changing shape as it swings—perceptual mechanisms take care of the problem for us by allowing us to see a constant shape.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p09">The visual system also corrects for color constancy. Imagine that you are wearing blue jeans and a bright white t-shirt. When you are outdoors, both colors will be at their brightest, but you will still perceive the white t-shirt as bright and the blue jeans as darker. When you go indoors, the light shining on the clothes will be significantly dimmer, but you will still perceive the t-shirt as bright. This is because we put colors in context and see that, compared to its surroundings, the white t-shirt reflects the most light (McCann, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_049">McCann, J. J. (1992). Rules for color constancy. <em class="emphasis">Ophthalmic and Physiologic Optics, 12</em>(2), 175–177.</span> In the same way, a green leaf on a cloudy day may reflect the same wavelength of light as a brown tree branch does on a sunny day. Nevertheless, we still perceive the leaf as green and the branch as brown.</p>

The line segment in the bottom arrow looks longer to us than the one on the top, even though they are both actually the same length. It is likely that the illusion is, in part, the result of the failure of monocular depth cues—the bottom line looks like an edge that is normally farther away from us, whereas the top one looks like an edge that is normally closer.</p>

            <p class="para">The Mueller-Lyre illusion makes the line segment at the top of the left picture appear shorter than the one at the bottom.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s02_p03">The <em class="emphasis">moon illusion</em> refers to the fact that the moon is perceived to be about 50% larger when it is near the horizon than when it is seen overhead, despite the fact that both moons are the same size and cast the same size retinal image. The monocular depth cues of position and aerial perspective (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s05_s02_f03">Figure 4.36 "The Moon Illusion"</a>) create the illusion that things that are lower and more hazy are farther away. The skyline of the horizon (trees, clouds, outlines of buildings) also gives a cue that the moon is far away, compared to a moon at its zenith. If we look at a horizon moon through a tube of rolled up paper, taking away the surrounding horizon cues, the moon will immediately appear smaller.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s02_p04">The <em class="emphasis">Ponzo illusion</em> operates on the same principle.

The monocular depth cue of linear perspective leads us to believe that, given two similar objects, the distant one can only cast the same size retinal image as the closer object if it is larger. The topmost bar therefore appears longer.</p>

Knowledge of the visual system also helped engineers create new kinds of displays, such as those used on notebook computers and music players, and better understand how using cell phones while driving may contribute to automobile accidents (Lee &amp; Strayer, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_063">Lee, J., &amp; Strayer, D.

About two thirds of accidents on commercial airplane flights are caused by human error (Nickerson, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_064">Nickerson, R. S. (1998).

The need for a useable interface that works easily and naturally with the pilot’s visual perception is essential.</p>

Kraft’s findings caused airlines to institute new flight safety measures, where copilots must call out the altitude progressively during the descent, which has probably decreased the number of landing accidents.</p>

On the left is the initial design in which the controls were crowded and cluttered, in no logical sequence, each control performing one task. The controls were more or less the same in color, and the gauges were not easy to read. The redesigned digital cockpit (right on <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s05_s03_f01">Figure 4.38</a>) shows a marked improvement in usability. More of the controls are color-coded and multifunctional so that there is less clutter on the dashboard. Screens make use of LCD and 3-D graphics. Text sizes are changeable—increasing readability—and many of the functions have become automated, freeing up the pilots concentration for more important activities.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s03_p07">One important aspect of the redesign was based on the principles of sensory adaptation. Displays that are easy to see in darker conditions quickly become unreadable when the sun shines directly on them. It takes the pilot a relatively long time to adapt to the suddenly much brighter display. Furthermore, perceptual contrast is important. The display cannot be so bright at night that the pilot is unable to see targets in the sky or on the land. Human factors psychologists used these principles to determine the appropriate stimulus intensity needed on these displays so that pilots would be able to read them accurately and quickly under a wide range of conditions. The psychologists accomplished this by developing an automatic control mechanism that senses the ambient light visible through the front cockpit windows and that detects the light falling on the display surface, and then automatically adjusts the intensity of the display for the pilot (Silverstein, Krantz, Gomer, Yeh, &amp; Monty, 1990; Silverstein &amp; Merrifield, 1985).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_066">Silverstein, L.
