        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_p01">In 1986 Anne Adams was working as a cell biologist at the University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada. She took a leave of absence from her work to care for a sick child, and while she was away, she completely changed her interests, dropping biology entirely and turning her attention to art. In 1994 she completed her painting <em class="emphasis">Unravelling Boléro</em>, a translation of Maurice Ravel’s famous orchestral piece onto canvas. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_f01">Figure 3.1</a>, this artwork is a filled with themes of repetition. Each bar of music is represented by a lacy vertical figure, with the height representing volume, the shape representing note quality, and the color representing the music’s pitch. Like Ravel’s music (see the video below), which is a hypnotic melody consisting of two melodial themes repeated eight times over 340 musical bars, the theme in the painting repeats and builds, leading to a dramatic change in color from blue to orange and pink, a representation of <em class="emphasis">Boléro</em>’s sudden and dramatic climax.</p>

        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_p02">Shortly after finishing the painting, Adams began to experience behavioral problems, including increased difficulty speaking. Neuroimages of Adams’s brain taken during this time show that regions in the front part of her brain, which are normally associated with language processing, had begun to deteriorate, while at the same time, regions of the brain responsible for the integration of information from the five senses were unusually well developed (Seeley et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_001">Seeley, W.

        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_p03">What Adams did not know at the time was that her brain may have been undergoing the same changes that Ravel’s had undergone 66 years earlier. In fact, it appears that Ravel may have suffered from the same neurological disorder. Ravel composed <em class="emphasis">Boléro</em> at age 53, when he himself was beginning to show behavioral symptoms that were interfering with his ability to move and speak. Scientists have concluded, based on an analysis of his written notes and letters, that Ravel was also experiencing the effects of frontotemporal dementia (Amaducci, Grassi, &amp; Boller, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_004">Amaducci, L., Grassi, E., &amp; Boller, F.

Maurice Ravel and right-hemisphere musical creativity: Influence of disease on his last musical works? <em class="emphasis">European Journal of Neurology, 9</em>(1), 75–82.</span> If Adams and Ravel were both affected by the same disease, this could explain why they both became fascinated with the repetitive aspects of their arts, and it would present a remarkable example of the influence of our brains on behavior.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_p04">Every behavior begins with biology. Our behaviors, as well as our thoughts and feelings, are produced by the actions of our brains, nerves, muscles, and glands. In this chapter we will begin our journey into the world of psychology by considering the biological makeup of the human being, including the most remarkable of human organs—the brain. We’ll consider the structure of the brain and also the methods that psychologists use to study the brain and to understand how it works.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_p05">We will see that the body is controlled by an information highway known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nervous system</a><span class="glossdef">A collection of hundreds of billions of specialized cells that transmit information between different parts of the body.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a collection of hundreds of billions of specialized and interconnected cells through which messages are sent between the brain and the rest of the body</em>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_p06">Although this chapter begins at a very low level of explanation, and although the topic of study may seem at first to be far from the everyday behaviors that we all engage in, a full understanding of the biology underlying psychological processes is an important cornerstone of your new understanding of psychology. We will consider throughout the chapter how our biology influences important human behaviors, including our mental and physical health, our reactions to drugs, as well as our aggressive responses and our perceptions of other people. This chapter is particularly important for contemporary psychology because the ability to measure biological aspects of behavior, including the structure and function of the human brain, is progressing rapidly, and understanding the biological foundations of behavior is an increasingly important line of psychological study.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_p02">Some neurons have hundreds or even thousands of dendrites, and these dendrites may themselves be branched to allow the cell to receive information from thousands of other cells. The axons are also specialized, and some, such as those that send messages from the spinal cord to the muscles in the hands or feet, may be very long—even up to several feet in length.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p01">The nervous system operates using an <em class="emphasis">electrochemical</em> process (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s01_n01">Note 3.12 "Video Clip: The Electrochemical Action of the Neuron"</a>). An electrical charge moves through the neuron itself and chemicals are used to transmit information between neurons. Within the neuron, when a signal is received by the dendrites, is it transmitted to the soma in the form of an electrical signal, and, if the signal is strong enough, it may then be passed on to the axon and then to the terminal buttons. If the signal reaches the terminal buttons, they are signaled to emit chemicals known as <em class="emphasis">neurotransmitters</em>, which communicate with other neurons across the spaces between the cells, known as <em class="emphasis">synapses</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p02">The electrical signal moves through the neuron as a result of changes in the electrical charge of the axon. Normally, the axon remains in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">resting potential</a><span class="glossdef">A state in which the interior of the neuron contains a greater number of negatively charged ions than does the area outside the cell.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a state in which the interior of the neuron contains a greater number of negatively charged ions than does the area outside the cell</em>. When the segment of the axon that is closest to the cell body is stimulated by an electrical signal from the dendrites, and if this electrical signal is strong enough that it passes a certain level or <em class="emphasis">threshold</em>, the cell membrane in this first segment opens its gates, allowing positively charged sodium ions that were previously kept out to enter. This <em class="emphasis">change in electrical charge that occurs in a neuron when a nerve impulse is transmitted</em> is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">action potential</a><span class="glossdef">A change in electrical charge that occurs in a neuron when a nerve impulse is transmitted.</span></span>. Once the action potential occurs, the number of positive ions exceeds the number of negative ions in this segment, and the segment temporarily becomes positively charged.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p03">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 3.4 "The Myelin Sheath and the Nodes of Ranvier"</a>, the axon is segmented by a series of <em class="emphasis">breaks between the sausage-like segments of the myelin sheath</em>. Each of these gaps is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">node of Ranvier</a><span class="glossdef">The break in the myelin sheath of a nerve fiber.</span></span>. The electrical charge moves down the axon from segment to segment, in a set of small jumps, moving from node to node. When the action potential occurs in the first segment of the axon, it quickly creates a similar change in the next segment, which then stimulates the next segment, and so forth as the positive electrical impulse continues all the way down to the end of the axon. As each new segment becomes positive, the membrane in the prior segment closes up again, and the segment returns to its negative resting potential. In this way the action potential is transmitted along the axon, toward the terminal buttons. The entire response along the length of the axon is very fast—it can happen up to 1,000 times each second.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p04">An important aspect of the action potential is that it operates in an <em class="emphasis">all or nothing</em> manner. What this means is that the neuron either fires completely, such that the action potential moves all the way down the axon, or it does not fire at all. Thus neurons can provide more energy to the neurons down the line by firing faster but not by firing more strongly. Furthermore, the neuron is prevented from repeated firing by the presence of a <em class="emphasis">refractory period</em>—a brief time after the firing of the axon in which the axon cannot fire again because the neuron has not yet returned to its resting potential.</p>

The synapses provide a remarkable function because they allow each axon to communicate with many dendrites in neighboring cells. Because a neuron may have synaptic connections with thousands of other neurons, the communication links among the neurons in the nervous system allow for a highly sophisticated communication system.</p>

Neurotransmitters travel across the synaptic space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrites of other neurons, where they bind to the dendrites in the neighboring neurons. Furthermore, different terminal buttons release different neurotransmitters, and different dendrites are particularly sensitive to different neurotransmitters. The dendrites will admit the neurotransmitters only if they are the right shape to fit in the receptor sites on the receiving neuron. For this reason, the receptor sites and neurotransmitters are often compared to a lock and key (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s02_f01">Figure 3.5 "The Synapse"</a>).</p>

Furthermore, if the receiving neuron is able to accept more than one neurotransmitter, then it will be influenced by the excitatory and inhibitory processes of each. If the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitters are greater than the inhibitory influences of the neurotransmitters, the neuron moves closer to its firing threshold, and if it reaches the threshold, the action potential and the process of transferring information through the neuron begins.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p05">More than 100 chemical substances produced in the body have been identified as neurotransmitters, and these substances have a wide and profound effect on emotion, cognition, and behavior. Neurotransmitters regulate our appetite, our memory, our emotions, as well as our muscle action and movement. And as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s02_t01">Table 3.1 "The Major Neurotransmitters and Their Functions"</a>, some neurotransmitters are also associated with psychological and physical diseases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p06">Drugs that we might ingest—either for medical reasons or recreationally—can act like neurotransmitters to influence our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

When an agonist is ingested, it binds to the receptor sites in the dendrites to excite the neuron, acting as if more of the neurotransmitter had been present. As an example, cocaine is an agonist for the neurotransmitter dopamine. Because dopamine produces feelings of pleasure when it is released by neurons, cocaine creates similar feelings when it is ingested. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">antagonist</a><span class="glossdef">A drug that reduces or stops the normal effects of a neurotransmitter.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a drug that reduces or stops the normal effects of a neurotransmitter</em>. When an antagonist is ingested, it binds to the receptor sites in the dendrite, thereby blocking the neurotransmitter. As an example, the poison curare is an antagonist for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. When the poison enters the brain, it binds to the dendrites, stops communication among the neurons, and usually causes death. Still other drugs work by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter itself—when reuptake is reduced by the drug, more neurotransmitter remains in the synapse, increasing its action.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_p01">If you were someone who understood brain anatomy and were to look at the brain of an animal that you had never seen before, you would nevertheless be able to deduce the likely capacities of the animal. This is because the brains of all animals are very similar in overall form. In each animal the brain is layered, and the basic structures of the brain are similar (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_f01">Figure 3.6 "The Major Structures in the Human Brain"</a>). The innermost structures of the brain—the parts nearest the spinal cord—are the oldest part of the brain, and these areas carry out the same the functions they did for our distant ancestors. The “old brain” regulates basic survival functions, such as breathing, moving, resting, and feeding, and creates our experiences of emotion. Mammals, including humans, have developed further brain layers that provide more advanced functions—for instance, better memory, more sophisticated social interactions, and the ability to experience emotions. Humans have a very large and highly developed outer layer known as the <em class="emphasis">cerebral cortex</em> (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_f02">Figure 3.7 "Cerebral Cortex"</a>), which makes us particularly adept at these processes.</p>

The job of the reticular formation is to filter out some of the stimuli that are coming into the brain from the spinal cord and to relay the remainder of the signals to other areas of the brain. The reticular formation also plays important roles in walking, eating, sexual activity, and sleeping. When electrical stimulation is applied to the reticular formation of an animal, it immediately becomes fully awake, and when the reticular formation is severed from the higher brain regions, the animal falls into a deep coma.</p>

Electrical stimulation of the amygdala in other animals also influences aggression. In addition to helping us experience fear, the amygdala also helps us learn from situations that create fear. When we experience events that are dangerous, the amygdala stimulates the brain to remember the details of the situation so that we learn to avoid it in the future (Sigurdsson, Doyère, Cain, &amp; LeDoux, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_009">Sigurdsson, T., Doyère, V., Cain, C.

On the other hand, although the human brain is one 60th of its body weight, the mouse’s brain represents one fortieth of its body weight.

Furthermore, they discovered an important and unexpected principle of brain activity. They found that stimulating the right side of the brain produced movement in the left side of the dog’s body, and vice versa. This finding follows from a general principle about how the brain is structured, called <em class="emphasis">contralateral control</em>. The brain is wired such that in most cases the left hemisphere receives sensations from and controls the right side of the body, and vice versa.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p02">Fritsch and Hitzig also found that the movement that followed the brain stimulation only occurred when they stimulated a specific arch-shaped region that runs across the top of the brain from ear to ear, just at the front of the parietal lobe (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 3.11 "The Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex"</a>).

More recent research has mapped the motor cortex even more fully, by providing mild electronic stimulation to different areas of the motor cortex in fully conscious patients while observing their bodily responses (because the brain has no sensory receptors, these patients feel no pain). As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 3.11 "The Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex"</a>, this research has revealed that the motor cortex is specialized for providing control over the body, in the sense that the parts of the body that require more precise and finer movements, such as the face and the hands, also are allotted the greatest amount of cortical space.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p01">The control of some specific bodily functions, such as movement, vision, and hearing, is performed in specified areas of the cortex, and if these areas are damaged, the individual will likely lose the ability to perform the corresponding function. For instance, if an infant suffers damage to facial recognition areas in the temporal lobe, it is likely that he or she will never be able to recognize faces (Farah, Rabinowitz, Quinn, &amp; Liu, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_017">Farah, M.

Early commitment of neural substrates for face recognition. <em class="emphasis">Cognitive Neuropsychology, 17</em>(1–3), 117–123.</span> On the other hand, the brain is not divided up in an entirely rigid way. The brain’s neurons have a remarkable capacity to reorganize and extend themselves to carry out particular functions in response to the needs of the organism, and to repair damage. As a result, the brain constantly creates new neural communication routes and rewires existing ones. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Neuroplasticity</a><span class="glossdef">The brain’s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience or damage.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the brain’s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience or damage</em>. Neuroplasticity enables us to learn and remember new things and adjust to new experiences.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p02">Our brains are the most “plastic” when we are young children, as it is during this time that we learn the most about our environment. On the other hand, neuroplasticity continues to be observed even in adults (Kolb &amp; Fantie, 1989).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_018">Kolb, B., &amp; Fantie, B. (1989). Development of the child’s brain and behavior. In C. R. Reynolds &amp; E. Fletcher-Janzen (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of clinical child neuropsychology</em> (pp. 17–39). New York, NY: Plenum Press.</span> The principles of neuroplasticity help us understand how our brains develop to reflect our experiences. For instance, accomplished musicians have a larger auditory cortex compared with the general population (Bengtsson et al., 2005)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_019">Bengtsson, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p03">Plasticity is also observed when there is damage to the brain or to parts of the body that are represented in the motor and sensory cortexes. When a tumor in the left hemisphere of the brain impairs language, the right hemisphere will begin to compensate to help the person recover the ability to speak (Thiel et al., 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_021">Thiel, A., Habedank, B., Herholz, K., Kessler, J., Winhuisen, L., Haupt, W.

As a result, the patient essentially becomes a person with two separate brains. Because the left and right hemispheres are separated, each hemisphere develops a mind of its own, with its own sensations, concepts, and motivations (Gazzaniga, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_026">Gazzaniga, M.

The researchers had W. J. look straight ahead and then flashed, for a fraction of a second, a picture of a geometrical shape to the left of where he was looking. By doing so, they assured that—because the two hemispheres had been separated—the image of the shape was experienced only in the right brain hemisphere (remember that sensory input from the left side of the body is sent to the right side of the brain). Gazzaniga and his colleagues found that W. J. was able to identify what he had been shown when he was asked to pick the object from a series of shapes, using his left hand, but that he could not do this when the object was shown in the right visual field. On the other hand, W. J. could easily read written material presented in the right visual field (and thus experienced in the left hemisphere) but not when it was presented in the left visual field.</p>

In split-brain patients, the severed corpus callosum does not permit information to be transferred between hemispheres, which allows researchers to learn about the functions of each hemisphere. In the sample on the left, the split-brain patient could not choose which image had been presented because the left hemisphere cannot process visual information.  In the sample on the right the patient could not read the passage because the right brain hemisphere cannot process language.</p>

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p07">This research, and many other studies following it, has demonstrated that the two brain hemispheres specialize in different abilities. In most people the ability to speak, write, and understand language is located in the left hemisphere. This is why W. J. could read passages that were presented on the right side and thus transmitted to the left hemisphere, but could not read passages that were only experienced in the right brain hemisphere. The left hemisphere is also better at math and at judging time and rhythm. It is also superior in coordinating the order of complex movements—for example, lip movements needed for speech. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, has only very limited verbal abilities, and yet it excels in perceptual skills. The right hemisphere is able to recognize objects, including faces, patterns, and melodies, and it can put a puzzle together or draw a picture. This is why W. J. could pick out the image when he saw it on the left, but not the right, visual field.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p08">Although Gazzaniga’s research demonstrated that the brain is in fact lateralized, such that the two hemispheres specialize in different activities, this does not mean that when people behave in a certain way or perform a certain activity they are only using one hemisphere of their brains at a time. That would be drastically oversimplifying the concept of brain differences. We normally use both hemispheres at the same time, and the difference between the abilities of the two hemispheres is not absolute (Soroker et al., 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_027">Soroker, N., Kasher, A., Giora, R., Batori, G., Corn, C., Gil, M., &amp; Zaidel, E.

The existence of right-handers and left-handers provides an interesting example of the relationship among evolution, biology, and social factors and how the same phenomenon can be understood at different levels of analysis (Harris, 1990; McManus, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_029">Harris, L.

Throughout history, a number of prominent artists have been left-handed, including Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Pablo Picasso, and Max Escher. Because the right hemisphere is superior in imaging and visual abilities, there may be some advantage to using the left hand for drawing or painting (Springer &amp; Deutsch, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_035">Springer, S.

They play many games against right-handers and learn how to best handle their styles. Right-handers, however, play very few games against left-handers, which may make them more vulnerable. This explains why a disproportionately high number of left-handers are found in sports where direct one-on-one action predominates. In other sports, such as golf, there are fewer left-handed players because the handedness of one player has no effect on the competition.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p15">The fact that left-handers excel in some sports suggests the possibility that they may have also had an evolutionary advantage because their ancestors may have been more successful in important skills such as hand-to-hand combat (Bodmer &amp; McKie, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_039">Bodmer, W., &amp; McKie, R.

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_p01">One problem in understanding the brain is that it is difficult to get a good picture of what is going on inside it. But there are a variety of empirical methods that allow scientists to look at brains in action, and the number of possibilities has increased dramatically in recent years with the introduction of new <em class="emphasis">neuroimaging</em> techniques. In this section we will consider the various techniques that psychologists use to learn about the brain. Each of the different techniques has some advantages, and when we put them together, we begin to get a relatively good picture of how the brain functions and which brain structures control which activities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_p02">Perhaps the most immediate approach to visualizing and understanding the structure of the brain is to directly analyze the brains of human cadavers. When Albert Einstein died in 1955, his brain was removed and stored for later analysis. Researcher Marian Diamond (1999)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_040">Diamond, M. C. (1999). Why Einstein’s brain? <em class="emphasis">New Horizons for Learning</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.newhorizons.org/neuro/diamond_einstein.htm">http://www.newhorizons.org/neuro/diamond_einstein.htm</a></span> later analyzed a section of the Einstein’s cortex to investigate its characteristics. Diamond was interested in the role of glia, and she hypothesized that the ratio of glial cells to neurons was an important determinant of intelligence. To test this hypothesis, she compared the ratio of glia to neurons in Einstein’s brain with the ratio in the preserved brains of 11 other more “ordinary” men. However, Diamond was able to find support for only part of her research hypothesis. Although she found that Einstein’s brain had relatively more glia in all the areas that she studied than did the control group, the difference was only statistically significant in one of the areas she tested. Diamond admits a limitation in her study is that she had only one Einstein to compare with 11 ordinary men.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Lesions Provide a Picture of What Is Missing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s01_p01">An advantage of the cadaver approach is that the brains can be fully studied, but an obvious disadvantage is that the brains are no longer active. In other cases, however, we can study living brains. The brains of living human beings may be damaged, for instance, as a result of strokes, falls, automobile accidents, gunshots, or tumors. These damages are called <em class="emphasis">lesions</em>. In rare occasions, brain lesions may be created intentionally through surgery, such as that designed to remove brain tumors or (as in split-brain patients) to reduce the effects of epilepsy. Psychologists also sometimes intentionally create lesions in animals to study the effects on their behavior. In so doing, they hope to be able to draw inferences about the likely functions of human brains from the effects of the lesions in animals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s01_p02">Lesions allow the scientist to observe any loss of brain function that may occur. For instance, when an individual suffers a stroke, a blood clot deprives part of the brain of oxygen, killing the neurons in the area and rendering that area unable to process information. In some cases, the result of the stroke is a specific lack of ability. For instance, if the stroke influences the occipital lobe, then vision may suffer, and if the stroke influences the areas associated with language or speech, these functions will suffer. In fact, our earliest understanding of the specific areas involved in speech and language were gained by studying patients who had experienced strokes.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s01_p03">It is now known that a good part of our moral reasoning abilities are located in the frontal lobe, and at least some of this understanding comes from lesion studies. For instance, consider the well-known case of Phineas Gage, a 25-year-old railroad worker who, as a result of an explosion, had an iron rod driven into his cheek and out through the top of his skull, causing major damage to his frontal lobe (Macmillan, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_041">Macmillan, M. (2000). <em class="emphasis">An odd kind of fame: Stories of Phineas Gage</em>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</span> Although remarkably Gage was able to return to work after the wounds healed, he no longer seemed to be the same person to those who knew him. The amiable, soft-spoken Gage had become irritable, rude, irresponsible, and dishonest. Although there are questions about the interpretation of this case study (Kotowicz, 2007),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_042">Kotowicz, Z. (2007). The strange case of Phineas Gage. <em class="emphasis">History of the Human Sciences, 20</em>(1), 115–131.</span> it did provide early evidence that the frontal lobe is involved in emotion and morality (Damasio et al., 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_043">Damasio, H., Grabowski, T., Frank, R., Galaburda, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s01_p04">More recent and more controlled research has also used patients with lesions to investigate the source of moral reasoning.

EEGs can also track the waves that are produced when a person is reading, writing, and speaking, and are useful for understanding brain abnormalities, such as epilepsy. A particular advantage of EEG is that the participant can move around while the recordings are being taken, which is useful when measuring brain activity in children who often have difficulty keeping still. Furthermore, by following electrical impulses across the surface of the brain, researchers can observe changes over very fast time periods.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Peeking Inside the Brain: Neuroimaging</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p01">Although the EEG can provide information about the general patterns of electrical activity within the brain, and although the EEG allows the researcher to see these changes quickly as they occur in real time, the electrodes must be placed on the surface of the skull and each electrode measures brain waves from large areas of the brain. As a result, EEGs do not provide a very clear picture of the structure of the brain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p02">But techniques exist to provide more specific brain images. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</a><span class="glossdef">A neuroimaging technique that uses a magnetic field to create images of brain structure and function.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a type of brain scan that uses a magnetic field to create images of brain activity in each brain area</em>. The patient lies on a bed within a large cylindrical structure containing a very strong magnet. Neurons that are firing use more oxygen, and the need for oxygen increases blood flow to the area. The fMRI detects the amount of blood flow in each brain region, and thus is an indicator of neural activity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p03">Very clear and detailed pictures of brain structures (see, e.g., <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s03_s03_f01">Figure 3.16 "fMRI Image"</a>) can be produced via fMRI. Often, the images take the form of cross-sectional “slices” that are obtained as the magnetic field is passed across the brain. The images of these slices are taken repeatedly and are superimposed on images of the brain structure itself to show how activity changes in different brain structures over time. When the research participant is asked to engage in tasks while in the scanner (e.g., by playing a game with another person), the images can show which parts of the brain are associated with which types of tasks. Another advantage of the fMRI is that is it noninvasive. The research participant simply enters the machine and the scans begin.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p04">Although the scanners themselves are expensive, the advantages of fMRIs are substantial, and they are now available in many university and hospital settings. fMRI is now the most commonly used method of learning about brain structure.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p05">There is still one more approach that is being more frequently implemented to understand brain function, and although it is new, it may turn out to be the most useful of all. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</a><span class="glossdef">A procedure in which magnetic pulses are applied to the brain of living persons with the goal of temporarily and safely deactivating a small brain region.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a procedure in which magnetic pulses are applied to the brain of living persons with the goal of temporarily and safely deactivating a small brain region</em>. In TMS studies the research participant is first scanned in an fMRI machine to determine the exact location of the brain area to be tested. Then the electrical stimulation is provided to the brain before or while the participant is working on a cognitive task, and the effects of the stimulation on performance are assessed. If the participant’s ability to perform the task is influenced by the presence of the stimulation, then the researchers can conclude that this particular area of the brain is important to carrying out the task.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p06">The primary advantage of TMS is that it allows the researcher to draw causal conclusions about the influence of brain structures on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. When the TMS pulses are applied, the brain region becomes less active, and this deactivation is expected to influence the research participant’s responses. Current research has used TMS to study the brain areas responsible for emotion and cognition and their roles in how people perceive intention and approach moral reasoning (Kalbe et al., 2010; Van den Eynde et al., 2010; Young, Camprodon, Hauser, Pascual-Leone, &amp; Saxe, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_048">Kalbe, E., Schlegel, M., Sack, A.

An fMRI study of social exclusion. <em class="emphasis">Science, 302</em>(5643), 290–292.</span> tested the hypothesis that people who were excluded by others would report emotional distress and that images of their brains would show that they experienced pain in the same part of the brain where physical pain is normally experienced. In the experiment, 13 participants were each placed into an fMRI brain-imaging machine. The participants were told that they would be playing a computer “Cyberball” game with two other players who were also in fMRI machines (the two opponents did not actually exist, and their responses were controlled by the computer).</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p08">Each of the participants was measured under three different conditions. In the first part of the experiment, the participants were told that as a result of technical difficulties, the link to the other two scanners could not yet be made, and thus at first they could not engage in, but only watch, the game play. This allowed the researchers to take a baseline fMRI reading. Then, during a second inclusion scan, the participants played the game, supposedly with the two other players. During this time, the other players threw the ball to the participants. In the third, exclusion, scan, however, the participants initially received seven throws from the other two players but were then excluded from the game because the two players stopped throwing the ball to the participants for the remainder of the scan (45 throws).</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch03_s03_s03_p09">The results of the analyses showed that activity in two areas of the frontal lobe was significantly greater during the exclusion scan than during the inclusion scan. Because these brain regions are known from prior research to be active for individuals who are experiencing physical pain, the authors concluded that these results show that the physiological brain responses associated with being socially excluded by others are similar to brain responses experienced upon physical injury.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_p01">Now that we have considered how individual neurons operate and the roles of the different brain areas, it is time to ask how the body manages to “put it all together.” How do the complex activities in the various parts of the brain, the simple all-or-nothing firings of billions of interconnected neurons, and the various chemical systems within the body, work together to allow the body to respond to the social environment and engage in everyday behaviors? In this section we will see that the complexities of human behavior are accomplished through the joint actions of electrical and chemical processes in the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>

The <em class="emphasis">central nervous system (CNS)</em>, made up of the brain and spinal cord, is the major controller of the body’s functions, charged with interpreting sensory information and responding to it with its own directives. The CNS interprets information coming in from the senses, formulates an appropriate reaction, and sends responses to the appropriate system to respond accordingly. Everything that we see, hear, smell, touch, and taste is conveyed to us from our sensory organs as neural impulses, and each of the commands that the brain sends to the body, both consciously and unconsciously, travels through this system as well.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p04">If the central nervous system is the command center of the body, the <em class="emphasis">peripheral nervous system (PNS)</em> represents the front line.

As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s04_s01_f03">Figure 3.19 "The Autonomic Nervous System"</a>, the peripheral nervous system is itself divided into two subsystems, one controlling internal responses and one controlling external responses.</p>

Many of the actions of the ANS, such as heart rate and digestion, are automatic and out of our conscious control, but others, such as breathing and sexual activity, can be controlled and influenced by conscious processes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p06">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">somatic nervous system (SNS)</a><span class="glossdef">The division of the PNS that controls the external aspects of the body, including the skeletal muscles, skin, and sense organs.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the division of the PNS that controls the external aspects of the body</em>, including the skeletal muscles, skin, and sense organs.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p08">Our everyday activities are controlled by the interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. For example, when we get out of bed in the morning, we would experience a sharp drop in blood pressure if it were not for the action of the sympathetic system, which automatically increases blood flow through the body. Similarly, after we eat a big meal, the parasympathetic system automatically sends more blood to the stomach and intestines, allowing us to efficiently digest the food. And perhaps you’ve had the experience of not being at all hungry before a stressful event, such as a sports game or an exam (when the sympathetic division was primarily in action), but suddenly finding yourself starved afterward, as the parasympathetic takes over.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p01">The nervous system is designed to protect us from danger through its interpretation of and reactions to stimuli. But a primary function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is to interact with the <em class="emphasis">endocrine system</em> to elicit chemicals that provide another system for influencing our feelings and behaviors.</p>

When the hormones released by one gland arrive at receptor tissues or other glands, these receiving receptors may trigger the release of other hormones, resulting in a series of complex chemical chain reactions. The endocrine system works together with the nervous system to influence many aspects of human behavior, including growth, reproduction, and metabolism. And the endocrine system plays a vital role in emotions. Because the glands in men and women differ, hormones also help explain some of the observed behavioral differences between men and women. The major glands in the endocrine system are shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s04_s02_f01">Figure 3.20 "The Major Glands of the Endocrine System"</a>.</p>

The pituitary secretes hormones that influence our responses to pain as well as hormones that signal the ovaries and testes to make sex hormones. The pituitary gland also controls ovulation and the menstrual cycle in women. Because the pituitary has such an important influence on other glands, it is sometimes known as the “master gland.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p04">Other glands in the endocrine system include the <em class="emphasis">pancreas</em>, which secretes hormones designed to keep the body supplied with fuel to produce and maintain stores of energy; the <em class="emphasis">pineal gland</em>, located in the middle of the brain, which secretes melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the wake-sleep cycle; and the <em class="emphasis">thyroid</em> and <em class="emphasis">parathyroid glands</em>, which are responsible for determining how quickly the body uses energy and hormones, and controlling the amount of calcium in the blood and bones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p05">The body has two triangular <em class="emphasis">adrenal glands</em>, one atop each kidney.

The most important function of the adrenal glands is to secrete the hormones <em class="emphasis">epinephrine</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">adrenaline</em>) and <em class="emphasis">norepinephrine</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">noradrenaline</em>) when we are excited, threatened, or stressed. Epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulate the sympathetic division of the ANS, causing increased heart and lung activity, dilation of the pupils, and increases in blood sugar, which give the body a surge of energy to respond to a threat. The activity and role of the adrenal glands in response to stress provides an excellent example of the close relationship and interdependency of the nervous and endocrine systems. A quick-acting nervous system is essential for immediate activation of the adrenal glands, while the endocrine system mobilizes the body for action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p06"><em class="emphasis">The male sex glands</em>, known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">testes</a><span class="glossdef">The male sex glands.</span></span>, secrete a number of hormones, the most important of which is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">testosterone</a><span class="glossdef">The male sex hormone.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the male sex hormone</em>. Testosterone regulates body changes associated with sexual development, including enlargement of the penis, deepening of the voice, growth of facial and pubic hair, and the increase in muscle growth and strength.

Estrogen is involved in the development of female sexual features, including breast growth, the accumulation of body fat around the hips and thighs, and the growth spurt that occurs during puberty. Both estrogen and progesterone are also involved in pregnancy and the regulation of the menstrual cycle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p07">Recent research has pinpointed some of the important roles of the sex hormones in social behavior. Dabbs, Hargrove, and Heusel (1996)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_051">Dabbs, J. M., Jr., Hargrove, M. F., &amp; Heusel, C. (1996). Testosterone differences among college fraternities: Well-behaved vs. rambunctious. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Individual Differences, 20</em>(2), 157–161.</span> measured the testosterone levels of 240 men who were members of 12 fraternities at two universities. They also obtained descriptions of the fraternities from university officials, fraternity officers, yearbook and chapter house photographs, and researcher field notes. The researchers correlated the testosterone levels and the descriptions of each fraternity. They found that the fraternities with the highest average testosterone levels were also more wild and unruly, and one of these fraternities was known across campus for the crudeness of its behavior. On the other hand, the fraternities with the lowest average testosterone levels were more well behaved, friendly and pleasant, academically successful, and socially responsible. Banks and Dabbs (1996)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_052">Banks, T., &amp; Dabbs, J. M., Jr. (1996). Salivary testosterone and cortisol in delinquent and violent urban subculture. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social Psychology, 136</em>(1), 49–56.</span> found that juvenile delinquents and prisoners who had high levels of testosterone also acted more violently, and Tremblay et al. (1998) <span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_053">Tremblay, R. E., Schaal, B., Boulerice, B., Arseneault, L., Soussignan, R. G., Paquette, D., &amp; Laurent, D. (1998). Testosterone, physical aggression, dominance, and physical development in early adolescence. <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Behavioral Development, 22</em>(4), 753–777.</span> found that testosterone was related to toughness and leadership behaviors in adolescent boys. Although testosterone levels are higher in men than in women, the relationship between testosterone and aggression is not limited to males. Studies have also shown a positive relationship between testosterone and aggression and related behaviors (such as competitiveness) in women (Cashdan, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_054">Cashdan, E. (2003). Hormones and competitive aggression in women. <em class="emphasis">Aggressive Behavior, 29</em>(2), 107–115.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p08">It must be kept in mind that the observed relationships between testosterone levels and aggressive behavior that have been found in these studies do not prove that testosterone causes aggression—the relationships are only correlational. In fact, there is evidence that the relationship between violence and testosterone also goes in the other direction: Playing an aggressive game, such as tennis or even chess, increases the testosterone levels of the winners and decreases the testosterone levels of losers (Gladue, Boechler, &amp; McCaul, 1989; Mazur, Booth, &amp; Dabbs, 1992),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_055">Gladue, B.

(1992). Testosterone and chess competition. <em class="emphasis">Social Psychology Quarterly, 55</em>(1), 70–77.</span> and perhaps this is why excited soccer fans sometimes riot when their team wins.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p09">Recent research has also begun to document the role that female sex hormones may play in reactions to others. A study about hormonal influences on social-cognitive functioning (Macrae, Alnwick, Milne, &amp; Schloerscheidt, 2002)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_056">Macrae, C. N., Alnwick, K. A., Milne, A. B., &amp; Schloerscheidt, A. M. (2002). Person perception across the menstrual cycle: Hormonal influences on social-cognitive functioning. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 13</em>(6), 532–536.</span> found that women were more easily able to perceive and categorize male faces during the more fertile phases of their menstrual cycles. Although researchers did not directly measure the presence of hormones, it is likely that phase-specific hormonal differences influenced the women’s perceptions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p10">At this point you can begin to see the important role the hormones play in behavior. But the hormones we have reviewed in this section represent only a subset of the many influences that hormones have on our behaviors. In the chapters to come we will consider the important roles that hormones play in many other behaviors, including sleeping, sexual activity, and helping and harming others.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p01">All human behavior, thoughts, and feelings are produced by the actions of our brains, nerves, muscles, and glands.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p02">The body is controlled by the nervous system, consisting of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the endocrine system, which is made up of glands that create and control hormones.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p03">Neurons are the cells in the nervous system. Neurons are composed of a soma that contains the nucleus of the cell; a dendrite that collects information from other cells and sends the information to the soma; and a long segmented fiber, known as the axon, which transmits information away from the cell body toward other neurons and to the muscles and glands.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p04">The nervous system operates using an electrochemical process. An electrical charge moves through the neuron itself, and chemicals are used to transmit information between neurons. Within the neuron, the electrical charge occurs in the form of an action potential. The action potential operates in an all-or-nothing manner.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p05">Neurons are separated by junction areas known as synapses. Neurotransmitters travel across the synaptic space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrites of other neurons, where they bind to the dendrites in the neighboring neurons. More than 100 chemical substances produced in the body have been identified as neurotransmitters, and these substances have a wide and profound effect on emotion, cognition, and behavior.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p06">Drugs that we may ingest may either mimic (agonists) or block (antagonists) the operations of neurotransmitters.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p07">The brains of all animals are layered, and generally quite similar in overall form.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p08">The brain stem is the oldest and innermost region of the brain. It controls the most basic functions of life, including breathing, attention, and motor responses. The brain stem includes the medulla, the pons, and the reticular formation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p09">Above the brain stem are other parts of the old brain involved in the processing of behavior and emotions, including the thalamus, the cerebellum, and the limbic system. The limbic system includes the amygdala, the hypothalamus, and the hippocampus.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p10">The cerebral cortex contains about 20 billion nerve cells and 300 trillion synaptic connections, and it’s supported by billions more glial cells that surround and link to the neurons. The cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres, and each hemisphere is divided into four lobes, each separated by folds known as fissures.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p11">The frontal lobe is primarily responsible for thinking, planning, memory, and judgment. The parietal lobe is responsible for processing information about touch. The occipital lobe processes visual information, and the temporal lobe is responsible for hearing and language. The cortex also includes the motor cortex, the somatosensory cortex, the visual cortex, the auditory cortex, and the association areas.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p12">The brain can develop new neurons, a process known as neurogenesis, as well as new routes for neural communications (neuroplasticity).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p13">Psychologists study the brain using cadaver and lesion approaches, as well as through neuroimaging techniques that include electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p14">Sensory (afferent) neurons carry information from the sensory receptors, whereas motor (efferent) neurons transmit information to the muscles and glands. Interneurons, by far the most common of neurons, are located primarily within the CNS and responsible for communicating among the neurons.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p15">The peripheral nervous system is itself divided into two subsystems, one controlling internal responses (the autonomic nervous system, ANS) and one controlling external responses (the somatic nervous system). The sympathetic division of the ANS is involved in preparing the body for behavior by activating the organs and the glands in the endocrine system. The parasympathetic division of the ANS tends to calm the body by slowing the heart and breathing and by allowing the body to recover from the activities that the sympathetic system causes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s05_p16">Glands in the endocrine system include the pituitary gland, the pancreas, the adrenal glands, and the male and female sex glands. The male sex hormone testosterone and the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone play important roles in behavior and contribute to gender differences.</p>
