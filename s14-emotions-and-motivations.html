        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p01">He was 3,000 feet up in the air when the sudden loss of power in his airplane put his life, as well as the lives of 150 other passengers and crew members, in his hands.

        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p12">Some called it “grace under pressure,” and others the “miracle on the Hudson.” But psychologists see it as the ultimate in <em class="emphasis">emotion regulation</em>—the ability to control and productively use one’s emotions.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p13">The topic of this chapter is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">affect</a><span class="glossdef">The experience of feeling or emotion.</span></span>, defined as <em class="emphasis">the experience of feeling or emotion</em>. Affect is an essential part of the study of psychology because it plays such an important role in everyday life. As we will see, affect guides behavior, helps us make decisions, and has a major impact on our mental and physical health.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p14">The two fundamental components of affect are <em class="emphasis">emotions</em> and <em class="emphasis">motivation</em>. Both of these words have the same underlying Latin root, meaning “to move.” In contrast to cognitive processes that are calm, collected, and frequently rational, emotions and motivations involve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">arousal</a><span class="glossdef">Our experiences of the bodily responses created by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.</span></span>, or <em class="emphasis">our experiences of the bodily responses created by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)</em>. Because they involve arousal, emotions and motivations are “hot”—they “charge,” “drive,” or “move” our behavior.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p15">When we experience emotions or strong motivations, we <em class="emphasis">feel</em> the experiences. When we become aroused, the sympathetic nervous system provides us with energy to respond to our environment. The liver puts extra sugar into the bloodstream, the heart pumps more blood, our pupils dilate to help us see better, respiration increases, and we begin to perspire to cool the body. The stress hormones <em class="emphasis">epinephrine</em> and <em class="emphasis">norepinephrine</em> are released. We experience these responses as arousal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p16">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotion</a><span class="glossdef">A mental and physiological feeling state that directs our attention and guides our behavior.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a mental and physiological feeling state that directs our attention and guides our behavior</em>. Whether it is the thrill of a roller-coaster ride that elicits an unexpected scream, the flush of embarrassment that follows a public mistake, or the horror of a potential plane crash that creates an exceptionally brilliant response in a pilot, emotions move our actions. Emotions normally serve an adaptive role: We care for infants because of the love we feel for them, we avoid making a left turn onto a crowded highway because we fear that a speeding truck may hit us, and we are particularly nice to Mandy because we are feeling guilty that we didn’t go to her party. But emotions may also be destructive, such as when a frustrating experience leads us to lash out at others who do not deserve it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p17">Motivations are closely related to emotions. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">motivation</a><span class="glossdef">A driving force that initiates and directs behavior.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a driving force that initiates and directs behavior</em>. Some motivations are biological, such as the motivation for food, water, and sex. But there are a variety of other personal and social motivations that can influence behavior, including the motivations for social approval and acceptance, the motivation to achieve, and the motivation to take, or to avoid taking, risks (Morsella, Bargh, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_002">Morsella, E., Bargh, J. A., &amp; Gollwitzer, P. M. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Oxford handbook of human action</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> In each case we follow our motivations because they are rewarding. As predicted by basic theories of operant learning, motivations lead us to engage in particular behaviors because doing so makes us feel good.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p18">Motivations are often considered in psychology in terms of <em class="emphasis">drives</em>, which are internal states that are activated when the physiological characteristics of the body are out of balance, and <em class="emphasis">goals</em>, which are desired end states that we strive to attain. Motivation can thus be conceptualized as a series of behavioral responses that lead us to attempt to reduce drives and to attain goals by comparing our current state with a desired end state (Lawrence, Carver, &amp; Scheier, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_003">Lawrence, J. W., Carver, C. S., &amp; Scheier, M. F. (2002). Velocity toward goal attainment in immediate experience as a determinant of affect. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32</em>(4), 788–802.</span> Like a thermostat on an air conditioner, the body tries to maintain <em class="emphasis">homeostasis</em>, the natural state of the body’s systems, with goals, drives, and arousal in balance. When a drive or goal is aroused—for instance, when we are hungry—the thermostat turns on and we start to behave in a way that attempts to reduce the drive or meet the goal (in this case to seek food). As the body works toward the desired end state, the thermostat continues to check whether or not the end state has been reached. Eventually, the need or goal is satisfied (we eat), and the relevant behaviors are turned off. The body’s thermostat continues to check for homeostasis and is always ready to react to future needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p19">In addition to more basic motivations such as hunger, a variety of other personal and social motivations can also be conceptualized in terms of drives or goals. When the goal of studying for an exam is hindered because we take a day off from our schoolwork, we may work harder on our studying on the next day to move us toward our goal. When we are dieting, we may be more likely to have a big binge on a day when the scale says that we have met our prior day’s goals. And when we are lonely, the motivation to be around other people is aroused and we try to socialize. In many, if not most cases, our emotions and motivations operate out of our conscious awareness to guide our behavior (Freud, 1922; Hassin, Bargh, &amp; Zimerman, 2009; Williams, Bargh, Nocera, &amp; Gray, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_004">Freud, S. (1922). The unconscious. <em class="emphasis">The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 56</em>(3), 291; Hassin, R. R., Bargh, J. A., &amp; Zimerman, S. (2009). Automatic and flexible: The case of nonconscious goal pursuit. <em class="emphasis">Social Cognition, 27</em>(1), 20–36; Williams, L. E., Bargh, J. A., Nocera, C. C., &amp; Gray, J. R. (2009).

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p20">We begin this chapter by considering the role of affect on behavior, discussing the most important psychological theories of emotions. Then we will consider how emotions influence our mental and physical health. We will discuss how the experience of long-term <em class="emphasis">stress</em> causes illness, and then turn to research on <em class="emphasis">positive thinking</em> and what has been learned about the beneficial health effects of more positive emotions. Finally, we will review some of the most important human motivations, including the behaviors of eating and sex. The importance of this chapter is not only in helping you gain an understanding the principles of affect but also in helping you discover the important roles that affect plays in our everyday lives, and particularly in our mental and physical health. The study of the interface between affect and physical health—that principle that “everything that is physiological is also psychological”—is a key focus of the branch of psychology known as <em class="emphasis">health psychology</em>. The importance of this topic has made health psychology one of the fastest growing fields in psychology.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_p02">Not all of our emotions come from the old parts of our brain; we also interpret our experiences to create a more complex array of emotional experiences. For instance, the amygdala may sense fear when it senses that the body is falling, but that fear may be interpreted completely differently (perhaps even as “excitement”) when we are falling on a roller-coaster ride than when we are falling from the sky in an airplane that has lost power. The <em class="emphasis">cognitive interpretations that accompany emotions</em>—known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cognitive appraisal</a><span class="glossdef">The cognitive interpretations that accompany emotions.</span></span>—allow us to experience a much larger and more complex set of <em class="emphasis">secondary emotions</em>, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s01_f01">Figure 10.2 "The Secondary Emotions"</a>. Although they are in large part cognitive, our experiences of the secondary emotions are determined in part by arousal (on the vertical axis of <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s01_f01">Figure 10.2 "The Secondary Emotions"</a>) and in part by their <em class="emphasis">valence</em>—that is, whether they are pleasant or unpleasant feelings (on the horizontal axis of <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s01_f01">Figure 10.2 "The Secondary Emotions"</a>)</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_p03">When you succeed in reaching an important goal, you might spend some time enjoying your secondary emotions, perhaps the experience of joy, satisfaction, and contentment. But when your close friend wins a prize that you thought you had deserved, you might also experience a variety of secondary emotions (in this case, the negative ones)—for instance, feeling angry, sad, resentful, and ashamed. You might mull over the event for weeks or even months, experiencing these negative emotions each time you think about it (Martin &amp; Tesser, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_007">Martin, L.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_p04">The distinction between the primary and the secondary emotions is paralleled by two brain pathways: a fast pathway and a slow pathway (Damasio, 2000; LeDoux, 2000; Ochsner, Bunge, Gross, &amp; Gabrielli, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_008">Damasio, A.

Our response to the basic emotion of fear, for instance, is primarily determined by the fast pathway through the limbic system. When a car pulls out in front of us on the highway, the thalamus activates and sends an immediate message to the amygdala. We quickly move our foot to the brake pedal. Secondary emotions are more determined by the slow pathway through the frontal lobes in the cortex. When we stew in jealousy over the loss of a partner to a rival or recollect on our win in the big tennis match, the process is more complex. Information moves from the thalamus to the frontal lobes for cognitive analysis and integration, and then from there to the amygdala. We experience the arousal of emotion, but it is accompanied by a more complex cognitive appraisal, producing more refined emotions and behavioral responses.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_p05">Although emotions might seem to you to be more frivolous or less important in comparison to our more rational cognitive processes, both emotions and cognitions can help us make effective decisions. In some cases we take action after rationally processing the costs and benefits of different choices, but in other cases we rely on our emotions. Emotions become particularly important in guiding decisions when the alternatives between many complex and conflicting alternatives present us with a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity, making a complete cognitive analysis difficult. In these cases we often rely on our emotions to make decisions, and these decisions may in many cases be more accurate than those produced by cognitive processing (Damasio, 1994; Dijksterhuis, Bos, Nordgren, &amp; van Baaren, 2006; Nordgren &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2009; Wilson &amp; Schooler, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_009">Damasio, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s01_p01">Recall for a moment a situation in which you have experienced an intense emotional response. Perhaps you woke up in the middle of the night in a panic because you heard a noise that made you think that someone had broken into your house or apartment. Or maybe you were calmly cruising down a street in your neighborhood when another car suddenly pulled out in front of you, forcing you to slam on your brakes to avoid an accident. I’m sure that you remember that your emotional reaction was in large part physical. Perhaps you remember being flushed, your heart pounding, feeling sick to your stomach, or having trouble breathing. You were experiencing the physiological part of emotion—arousal—and I’m sure you have had similar feelings in other situations, perhaps when you were in love, angry, embarrassed, frustrated, or very sad.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s01_p02">If you think back to a strong emotional experience, you might wonder about the order of the events that occurred. Certainly you experienced arousal, but did the arousal come before, after, or along with the experience of the emotion? Psychologists have proposed three different theories of emotion, which differ in terms of the hypothesized role of arousal in emotion (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s01_s01_f01">Figure 10.4 "Three Theories of Emotion"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para">The Cannon-Bard theory proposes that emotions and arousal occur at the same time. The James-Lange theory proposes the emotion is the result of arousal. Schachter and Singer’s two-factor model proposes that arousal and cognition combine to create emotion.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s01_p03">If your experiences are like mine, as you reflected on the arousal that you have experienced in strong emotional situations, you probably thought something like, “I was afraid and my heart started beating like crazy.” At least some psychologists agree with this interpretation. According to the theory of emotion proposed by Walter Cannon and Philip Bard, the experience of the emotion (in this case, “I’m afraid”) occurs alongside our experience of the arousal (“my heart is beating fast”). According to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cannon-Bard theory of emotion</a><span class="glossdef">The idea that the experience of emotion is accompanied by physiological arousal.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the experience of an emotion is accompanied by physiological arousal</em>. Thus, according to this model of emotion, as we become aware of danger, our heart rate also increases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s01_p04">Although the idea that the experience of an emotion occurs alongside the accompanying arousal seems intuitive to our everyday experiences, the psychologists William James and Carl Lange had another idea about the role of arousal. According to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">James-Lange theory of emotion</a><span class="glossdef">The idea that the experience of emotion is the result of the arousal that we experience.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">our experience of an emotion is the result of the arousal that we experience</em>. This approach proposes that the arousal and the emotion are not independent, but rather that the emotion depends on the arousal. The fear does not occur along with the racing heart but occurs <em class="emphasis">because of</em> the racing heart. As William James put it, “We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble” (James, 1884, p. 190).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_010">James, W. (1884). What is an emotion? <em class="emphasis">Mind, 9</em>(34), 188–205.</span> A fundamental aspect of the James-Lange theory is that different patterns of arousal may create different emotional experiences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s01_p05">There is research evidence to support each of these theories. The operation of the fast emotional pathway (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s01_f02">Figure 10.3 "Slow and Fast Emotional Pathways"</a>) supports the idea that arousal and emotions occur together. The emotional circuits in the limbic system are activated when an emotional stimulus is experienced, and these circuits quickly create corresponding physical reactions (LeDoux, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_011">LeDoux, J. E. (2000). Emotion circuits in the brain. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Neuroscience, 23,</em> 155–184.</span> The process happens so quickly that it may feel to us as if emotion is simultaneous with our physical arousal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s01_p06">On the other hand, and as predicted by the James-Lange theory, our experiences of emotion are weaker without arousal. Patients who have spinal injuries that reduce their experience of arousal also report decreases in emotional responses (Hohmann, 1966).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_012">Hohmann, G. W. (1966). Some effects of spinal cord lesions on experienced emotional feelings. <em class="emphasis">Psychophysiology, 3</em>(2), 143–156.</span> There is also at least some support for the idea that different emotions are produced by different patterns of arousal. People who view fearful faces show more amygdala activation than those who watch angry or joyful faces (Whalen et al., 2001; Witvliet &amp; Vrana, 1995),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_013">Whalen, P.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p01">Whereas the James-Lange theory proposes that each emotion has a different pattern of arousal, the <em class="emphasis">two-factor theory</em> of emotion takes the opposite approach, arguing that the arousal that we experience is basically the same in every emotion, and that all emotions (including the basic emotions) are differentiated only by our cognitive appraisal of the source of the arousal. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">two-factor theory of emotion</a><span class="glossdef">The idea that the strength of emotion is determined by the intensity of the arousal we are experiencing, but that the cognitive appraisal of the situation determines what the emotion will be.</span></span> asserts that <em class="emphasis">the experience of emotion is determined by the intensity of the arousal we are experiencing, but that the cognitive appraisal of the situation determines what the emotion will be</em>. Because both arousal and appraisal are necessary, we can say that emotions have two factors: an arousal factor and a cognitive factor (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962):<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_016">Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p02">In some cases it may be difficult for a person who is experiencing a high level of arousal to accurately determine which emotion she is experiencing. That is, she may be certain that she is feeling arousal, but the meaning of the arousal (the cognitive factor) may be less clear. Some romantic relationships, for instance, have a very high level of arousal, and the partners alternatively experience extreme highs and lows in the relationship. One day they are madly in love with each other and the next they are in a huge fight. In situations that are accompanied by high arousal, people may be unsure what emotion they are experiencing. In the high arousal relationship, for instance, the partners may be uncertain whether the emotion they are feeling is love, hate, or both at the same time (sound familiar?). <em class="emphasis">The tendency for people to incorrectly label the source of the arousal that they are experiencing</em> is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">misattribution of arousal</a><span class="glossdef">When we incorrectly label the source of the arousal that we are experiencing.</span></span>.</p>

The woman asked each man to help her fill out a class questionnaire. When he had finished, she wrote her name and phone number on a piece of paper, and invited him to call if he wanted to hear more about the project. More than half of the men who had been interviewed on the bridge later called the woman. In contrast, men approached by the same woman on a low solid bridge, or who were interviewed on the suspension bridge by men, called significantly less frequently. The idea of misattribution of arousal can explain this result—the men were feeling arousal from the height of the bridge, but they misattributed it as romantic or sexual attraction to the woman, making them more likely to call her.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p04">If you think a bit about your own experiences of different emotions, and if you consider the equation that suggests that emotions are represented by both arousal and cognition, you might start to wonder how much was determined by each. That is, do we know what emotion we are experiencing by monitoring our feelings (arousal) or by monitoring our thoughts (cognition)? The bridge study you just read about might begin to provide you an answer: The men seemed to be more influenced by their perceptions of how they should be feeling (their cognition) rather than by how they actually were feeling (their arousal).</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p05">Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer (1962)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_018">Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J. E. (1962). Cognitive, social and physiological determinants of emotional state. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 69</em>, 379–399.</span> directly tested this prediction of the two-factor theory of emotion in a well-known experiment. Schachter and Singer believed that the cognitive part of the emotion was critical—in fact, they believed that the arousal that we are experiencing could be interpreted as any emotion, provided we had the right label for it. Thus they hypothesized that if an individual is experiencing arousal for which he has no immediate explanation, he will “label” this state in terms of the cognitions that are created in his environment. On the other hand, they argued that people who already have a clear label for their arousal would have no need to search for a relevant label, and therefore should not experience an emotion.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p06">In the research, male participants were told that they would be participating in a study on the effects of a new drug, called “suproxin,” on vision. On the basis of this cover story, the men were injected with a shot of the neurotransmitter epinephrine, a drug that normally creates feelings of tremors, flushing, and accelerated breathing in people. The idea was to give all the participants the experience of arousal.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p07">Then, according to random assignment to conditions, the men were told that the drug would make them feel certain ways. The men in the <em class="emphasis">epinephrine informed</em> condition were told the truth about the effects of the drug—they were told that they would likely experience tremors, their hands would start to shake, their hearts would start to pound, and their faces might get warm and flushed. The participants in the <em class="emphasis">epinephrine-uninformed</em> condition, however, were told something untrue—that their feet would feel numb, that they would have an itching sensation over parts of their body, and that they might get a slight headache. The idea was to make some of the men think that the arousal they were experiencing was caused by the drug (the <em class="emphasis">informed condition</em>), whereas others would be unsure where the arousal came from (the <em class="emphasis">uninformed condition</em>).</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p08">Then the men were left alone with a confederate who they thought had received the same injection. While they were waiting for the experiment (which was supposedly about vision) to begin, the confederate behaved in a wild and crazy (Schachter and Singer called it “euphoric”) manner. He wadded up spitballs, flew paper airplanes, and played with a hula-hoop. He kept trying to get the participant to join in with his games. Then right before the vision experiment was to begin, the participants were asked to indicate their current emotional states on a number of scales. One of the emotions they were asked about was euphoria.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p09">If you are following the story, you will realize what was expected: The men who had a label for their arousal (the <em class="emphasis">informed</em> group) would not be experiencing much emotion because they already had a label available for their arousal. The men in the <em class="emphasis">misinformed</em> group, on the other hand, were expected to be unsure about the source of the arousal. They needed to find an explanation for their arousal, and the confederate provided one. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s01_s02_f02">Figure 10.6 "Results From Schachter and Singer, 1962"</a> (left side), this is just what they found. The participants in the misinformed condition were more likely to be experiencing euphoria (as measured by their behavioral responses with the confederate) than were those in the informed condition.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p10">Then Schachter and Singer conducted another part of the study, using new participants. Everything was exactly the same except for the behavior of the confederate. Rather than being euphoric, he acted angry. He complained about having to complete the questionnaire he had been asked to do, indicating that the questions were stupid and too personal. He ended up tearing up the questionnaire that he was working on, yelling “I don’t have to tell them that!” Then he grabbed his books and stormed out of the room.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p11">What do you think happened in this condition? The answer is the same thing: The misinformed participants experienced more anger (again as measured by the participant’s behaviors during the waiting period) than did the informed participants. (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s01_s02_f02">Figure 10.6 "Results From Schachter and Singer, 1962"</a>, right side) The idea is that because cognitions are such strong determinants of emotional states, the same state of physiological arousal could be labeled in many different ways, depending entirely on the label provided by the social situation. As Schachter and Singer put it: “Given a state of physiological arousal for which an individual has no immediate explanation, he will ‘label’ this state and describe his feelings in terms of the cognitions available to him” (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962, p. 381).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_019">Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p12">Because it assumes that arousal is constant across emotions, the two-factor theory also predicts that emotions may transfer or “spill over” from one highly arousing event to another. My university basketball team recently won the NCAA basketball championship, but after the final victory some students rioted in the streets near the campus, lighting fires and burning cars. This seems to be a very strange reaction to such a positive outcome for the university and the students, but it can be explained through the spillover of the arousal caused by happiness to destructive behaviors. The principle of <em class="emphasis">excitation transfer</em> refers to the phenomenon that occurs when people who are already experiencing arousal from one event tend to also experience unrelated emotions more strongly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s02_p13">In sum, each of the three theories of emotion has something to support it. In terms of Cannon-Bard, emotions and arousal generally are subjectively experienced together, and the spread is very fast. In support of the James-Lange theory, there is at least some evidence that arousal is necessary for the experience of emotion, and that the patterns of arousal are different for different emotions. And in line with the two-factor model, there is also evidence that we may interpret the same patterns of arousal differently in different situations.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s03_p02">Just as there is no “universal” spoken language, there is no universal nonverbal language. For instance, in the United States and many Western cultures we express disrespect by showing the middle finger (the “finger” or the “bird”). But in Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the “V” sign (made with back of the hand facing the recipient) serves a similar purpose. In countries where Spanish, Portuguese, or French are spoken, a gesture in which a fist is raised and the arm is slapped on the bicep is equivalent to the finger, and in Russia, Indonesia, Turkey, and China a sign in which the hand and fingers are curled and the thumb is thrust between the middle and index fingers is used for the same purpose.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s03_p03">The most important communicator of emotion is the face. The face contains 43 different muscles that allow it to make more than 10,000 unique configurations and to express a wide variety of emotions. For example, happiness is expressed by smiles, which are created by two of the major muscles surrounding the mouth and the eyes, and anger is created by lowered brows and firmly pressed lips.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s03_p04">In addition to helping us express our emotions, the face also helps us feel emotion. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">facial feedback hypothesis</a><span class="glossdef">The idea that the movement of our facial muscles can trigger corresponding emotions.</span></span> proposes that <em class="emphasis">the movement of our facial muscles can trigger corresponding emotions</em>. Fritz Strack and his colleagues (1988)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_021">Strack, F., Martin, L., &amp; Stepper, S. (1988). Inhibiting and facilitating conditions of the human smile: A nonobtrusive test of the facial feedback hypothesis. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54</em>(5), 768–777. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.768</span> asked their research participants to hold a pen in their teeth (mimicking the facial action of a smile) or between their lips (similar to a frown), and then had them rate the funniness of a cartoon. They found that the cartoons were rated as more amusing when the pen was held in the “smiling” position—the subjective experience of emotion was intensified by the action of the facial muscles.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s03_p05">These results, and others like them, show that our behaviors, including our facial expressions, are influenced by, but also influence our affect.

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch10_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>Emotions are the normally adaptive mental and physiological feeling states that direct our attention and guide our behavior.</li>
                <li>Emotional states are accompanied by arousal, our experiences of the bodily responses created by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.</li>
                <li>Motivations are forces that guide behavior. They can be biological, such as hunger and thirst; personal, such as the motivation for achievement; or social, such as the motivation for acceptance and belonging.</li>
                <li>The most fundamental emotions, known as the basic emotions, are those of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.</li>
                <li>Cognitive appraisal allows us to also experience a variety of secondary emotions.</li>
                <li>According to the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion, the experience of an emotion is accompanied by physiological arousal.</li>
                <li>According to the James-Lange theory of emotion, our experience of an emotion is the result of the arousal that we experience.</li>
                <li>According to the two-factor theory of emotion, the experience of emotion is determined by the intensity of the arousal we are experiencing, and the cognitive appraisal of the situation determines what the emotion will be.</li>
                <li>When people incorrectly label the source of the arousal that they are experiencing, we say that they have misattributed their arousal.</li>
                <li>We express our emotions to others through nonverbal behaviors, and we learn about the emotions of others by observing them.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s01_p03">The initial arousal that accompanies stress is normally quite adaptive because it helps us respond to potentially dangerous events. The experience of prolonged stress, however, has a direct negative influence on our physical health, because at the same time that stress increases activity in the sympathetic division of the ANS, it also suppresses activity in the parasympathetic division of the ANS. When stress is long-term, the HPA axis remains active and the adrenals continue to produce cortisol. This increased cortisol production exhausts the stress mechanism, leading to fatigue and depression.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Responses to Stress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Not all people experience and respond to stress in the same way, and these differences can be important. The cardiologists Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman (1974)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_039">Friedman, M., &amp; Rosenman, R. H. (1974). <em class="emphasis">Type A behavior and your heart</em>. New York, NY: Knopf.</span> were among the first to study the link between stress and heart disease. In their research they noticed that even though the partners in married couples often had similar lifestyles, diet, and exercise patterns, the husbands nevertheless generally had more heart disease than did the wives. As they tried to explain the difference, they focused on the personality characteristics of the partners, finding that the husbands were more likely than the wives to respond to stressors with negative emotions and hostility.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p02">Recent research has shown that the strongest predictor of a physiological stress response from daily hassles is the amount of negative emotion that they evoke. People who experience strong negative emotions as a result of everyday hassles, and who respond to stress with hostility experience more negative health outcomes than do those who react in a less negative way (McIntyre, Korn, &amp; Matsuo, 2008; Suls &amp; Bunde, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_040">McIntyre, K., Korn, J., &amp; Matsuo, H.

Singer (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of health psychology</em>. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span> found that people who scored high on measures of anger were three times more likely to suffer from heart attacks in comparison to those who scored lower on anger.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p03">On average, men are more likely than are women to respond to stress by activating the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fight-or-flight response</a><span class="glossdef">An emotional and behavioral reaction to stress that increases the readiness for action.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">an emotional and behavioral reaction to stress that increases the readiness for action</em>. The arousal that men experience when they are stressed leads them to either go on the attack, in an aggressive or revenging way, or else retreat as quickly as they can to safety from the stressor. The fight-or-flight response allows men to control the source of the stress if they think they can do so, or if that is not possible, it allows them to save face by leaving the situation. The fight-or-flight response is triggered in men by the activation of the HPA axis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s03_p04">Women, on the other hand, are less likely to take a fight-or-flight response to stress. Rather, they are more likely to take a <em class="emphasis">tend-and-befriend response</em> (Taylor et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_042">Taylor, S. E., Klein, L.

This approach is also self-protective because it allows the individual to talk to others about her concerns, as well as to exchange resources, such as child care. The tend-and-befriend response is triggered in women by the release of the hormone <em class="emphasis">ocytocin</em>, which promotes affiliation. Overall, the tend-and-befriend response is healthier than the flight-or-flight response because it does not produce the elevated levels of arousal related to the HPA, including the negative results that accompany increased levels of cortisol. This may help explain why women, on average, have less heart disease and live longer than men.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Stress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p01">No matter how healthy and happy we are in our everyday lives, there are going to be times when we experience stress. But we do not need to throw up our hands in despair when things go wrong; rather, we can use our personal and social resources to help us.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p02">Perhaps the most common approach to dealing with negative affect is to attempt to suppress, avoid, or deny it. You probably know people who seem to be stressed, depressed, or anxious, but they cannot or will not see it in themselves. Perhaps you tried to talk to them about it, to get them to open up to you, but were rebuffed. They seem to act as if there is no problem at all, simply moving on with life without admitting or even trying to deal with the negative feelings. Or perhaps you have even taken a similar approach yourself. Have you ever had an important test to study for or an important job interview coming up, and rather than planning and preparing for it, you simply tried put it out of your mind entirely?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p03">Research has found that ignoring stress is not a good approach for coping with it. For one, ignoring our problems does not make them go away. If we experience so much stress that we get sick, these events will be detrimental to our life even if we do not or cannot admit that they are occurring. Suppressing our negative emotions is also not a very good option, at least in the long run, because it tends to fail (Gross &amp; Levenson, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_043">Gross, J. J., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1997). Hiding feelings: The acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 106</em>(1), 95–103.</span> For one, if we know that we have that big exam coming up, we have to focus on the exam itself to suppress it. We can’t really suppress or deny our thoughts, because we actually have to recall and face the event to make the attempt to not think about it. Doing so takes effort, and we get tired when we try to do it. Furthermore, we may continually worry that our attempts to suppress will fail. Suppressing our emotions might work out for a short while, but when we run out of energy the negative emotions may shoot back up into consciousness, causing us to reexperience the negative feelings that we had been trying to avoid.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p04">Daniel Wegner and his colleagues (Wegner, Schneider, Carter, &amp; White, 1987)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_044">Wegner, D. M., Schneider, D. J., Carter, S. R., &amp; White, T. L. (1987). Paradoxical effects of thought suppression. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53</em>(1), 5–13.</span> directly tested whether people would be able to effectively suppress a simple thought. He asked them to <em class="emphasis">not</em> think about a white bear for 5 minutes but to ring a bell in case they did. (Try it yourself; can you do it?) However, participants were unable to suppress the thought as instructed. The white bear kept popping into mind, even when the participants were instructed to avoid thinking about it. You might have had this experience when you were dieting or trying to study rather than party; the chocolate bar in the kitchen cabinet and the fun time you were missing at the party kept popping into mind, disrupting your work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p05">Suppressing our negative thoughts does not work, and there is evidence that the opposite is true: When we are faced with troubles, it is healthy to let out the negative thoughts and feelings by expressing them, either to ourselves or to others. James Pennebaker and his colleagues (Pennebaker, Colder, &amp; Sharp, 1990; Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_045">Pennebaker, J.

(1989). Health complaints, stress, and distress: Exploring the central role of negative affectivity. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 96</em>(2), 234–254.</span> have conducted many correlational and experimental studies that demonstrate the advantages to our mental and physical health of opening up versus suppressing our feelings. This research team has found that simply talking about or writing about our emotions or our reactions to negative events provides substantial health benefits. For instance, Pennebaker and Beall (1986)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_046">Pennebaker, J. W., &amp; Beall, S. K. (1986). Confronting a traumatic event: Toward an understanding of inhibition and disease. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 95</em>(3), 274–281.</span> randomly assigned students to write about either the most traumatic and stressful event of their lives or trivial topics. Although the students who wrote about the traumas had higher blood pressure and more negative moods immediately after they wrote their essays, they were also less likely to visit the student health center for illnesses during the following six months. Other research studied individuals whose spouses had died in the previous year, finding that the more they talked about the death with others, the less likely they were to become ill during the subsequent year. Daily writing about one’s emotional states has also been found to increase immune system functioning (Petrie, Fontanilla, Thomas, Booth, &amp; Pennebaker, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_047">Petrie, K.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s04_p06">Opening up probably helps in various ways. For one, expressing our problems to others allows us to gain information, and possibly support, from them (remember the <em class="emphasis">tend-and-befriend response</em> that is so effectively used to reduce stress by women). Writing or thinking about one’s experiences also seems to help people make sense of these events and may give them a feeling of control over their lives (Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_048">Pennebaker, J. W., &amp; Stone, L. D. (Eds.). (2004). <em class="emphasis">Translating traumatic experiences into language: Implications for child abuse and long-term health</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p01">Emotional responses such as the stress reaction are useful in warning us about potential danger and in mobilizing our response to it, so it is a good thing that we have them. However, we also need to learn how to control our emotions, to prevent them from letting our behavior get out of control. <em class="emphasis">The ability to successfully control our emotions</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotion regulation</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to successfully control our emotions.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p02">Emotion regulation has some important positive outcomes. Consider, for instance, research by Walter Mischel and his colleagues. In their studies, they had 4- and 5-year-old children sit at a table in front of a yummy snack, such as a chocolate chip cookie or a marshmallow. The children were told that they could eat the snack right away if they wanted. However, they were also told that if they could wait for just a couple of minutes, they’d be able to have two snacks—both the one in front of them and another just like it. However, if they ate the one that was in front of them before the time was up, they would not get a second.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p03">Mischel found that some children were able to override the impulse to seek immediate gratification to obtain a greater reward at a later time. Other children, of course, were not; they just ate the first snack right away. Furthermore, the inability to delay gratification seemed to occur in a spontaneous and emotional manner, without much thought. The children who could not resist simply grabbed the cookie because it looked so yummy, without being able to stop themselves (Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999; Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_050">Metcalfe, J., &amp; Mischel, W.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p04">The ability to regulate our emotions has important consequences later in life. When Mischel followed up on the children in his original study, he found that those who had been able to self-regulate grew up to have some highly positive characteristics: They got better SAT scores, were rated by their friends as more socially adept, and were found to cope with frustration and stress better than those children who could not resist the tempting cookie at a young age. Thus effective self-regulation can be recognized as an important key to success in life (Ayduk et al., 2000; Eigsti et al., 2006; Mischel &amp; Ayduk, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_051">Ayduk, O., Mendoza-Denton, R., Mischel, W., Downey, G., Peake, P.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p06">Emotion regulation is particularly difficult when we are tired, depressed, or anxious, and it is under these conditions that we more easily let our emotions get the best of us (Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_054">Muraven, M., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (2000). Self-regulation and depletion of limited resources: Does self-control resemble a muscle? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 126</em>(2), 247–259.</span> If you are tired and worried about an upcoming exam, you may find yourself getting angry and taking it out on your roommate, even though she really hasn’t done anything to deserve it and you don’t really want to be angry at her. It is no secret that we are more likely fail at our diets when we are under a lot of stress, or at night when we are tired.</p>

(1998). Self-control as a limited resource: Regulatory depletion patterns. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 74</em>(3), 774–789.</span> conducted a study to demonstrate that emotion regulation—that is, either increasing or decreasing our emotional responses—takes work. They speculated that self-control was like a muscle; it just gets tired when it is used too much. In their experiment they asked their participants to watch a short movie about environmental disasters involving radioactive waste and their negative effects on wildlife. The scenes included sick and dying animals and were very upsetting. According to random assignment to condition, one group (the <em class="emphasis">increase emotional response</em> condition) was told to really get into the movie and to express their emotions, one group was to hold back and decrease their emotional responses (the <em class="emphasis">decrease emotional response</em> condition), and the third (<em class="emphasis">control</em>) group received no emotional regulation instructions.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s02_s05_p08">Both before and after the movie, the experimenter asked the participants to engage in a measure of physical strength by squeezing as hard as they could on a handgrip exerciser, a device used for strengthening hand muscles. The experimenter put a piece of paper in the grip and timed how long the participants could hold the grip together before the paper fell out. <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s02_s05_f01">Figure 10.10 "Results From Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998"</a> shows the results of this study. It seems that emotion regulation does indeed take effort, because the participants who had been asked to control their emotions showed significantly less ability to squeeze the handgrip after the movie than they had showed before it, whereas the control group showed virtually no decrease. The emotion regulation during the movie seems to have consumed resources, leaving the participants with less capacity to perform the handgrip task.</p>

                <li>Stress is normally adaptive because it helps us respond to potentially dangerous events by activating the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. But the experience of prolonged stress has a direct negative influence on our physical health.</li>
                <li>Chronic stress is a major contributor to heart disease. It also decreases our ability to fight off colds and infections.</li>
                <li>Stressors can occur as a result of both major and minor everyday events.</li>
                <li>Men tend to respond to stress with the fight-or-flight response, whereas women are more likely to take a tend-and-befriend response.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_p01">Although stress is an emotional response that can kill us, our emotions can also help us cope with and protect ourselves from it. The stress of the Monday through Friday grind can be offset by the fun that we can have on the weekend, and the concerns that we have about our upcoming chemistry exam can be offset by a positive attitude toward school, life, and other people. Put simply, the best antidote for stress is a happy one: Think positively, have fun, and enjoy the company of others.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_p02">You have probably heard about the “power of positive thinking”—the idea that thinking positively helps people meet their goals and keeps them healthy, happy, and able to effectively cope with the negative events that occur to them. It turns out that positive thinking really works. People who think positively about their future, who believe that they can control their outcomes, and who are willing to open up and share with others are healthier people (Seligman, &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_058">Seligman, M.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_p03">The power of positive thinking comes in different forms, but they are all helpful. Some researchers have focused on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">optimism</a><span class="glossdef">The general tendency to expect positive outcomes.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a general tendency to expect positive outcomes</em>, finding that optimists are happier and have less stress (Carver &amp; Scheier, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_059">Carver, C.

People with high self-efficacy respond to environmental and other threats in an active, constructive way—by getting information, talking to friends, and attempting to face and reduce the difficulties they are experiencing. These people too are better able to ward off their stresses in comparison to people with less self-efficacy (Thompson, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_060">Thompson, S. C. (2009).

New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_p04">Self-efficacy helps in part because it leads us to perceive that we can control the potential stressors that may affect us. Workers who have control over their work environment (e.g., by being able to move furniture and control distractions) experience less stress, as do patients in nursing homes who are able to choose their everyday activities (Rodin, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_061">Rodin, J.

Hardiness and health: A prospective study. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42</em>(1), 168–177.</span> have argued that the tendency to be less affected by life’s stressors can be characterized as an individual difference measure that has a relationship to both optimism and self-efficacy known as <em class="emphasis">hardiness</em>. Hardy individuals are those who are more positive overall about potentially stressful life events, who take more direct action to understand the causes of negative events, and who attempt to learn from them what may be of value for the future. Hardy individuals use effective coping strategies, and they take better care of themselves.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_p06">Taken together, these various coping skills, including optimism, self-efficacy, and hardiness, have been shown to have a wide variety of positive effects on our health.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_p07">It is possible to learn to think more positively, and doing so can be beneficial. Antoni et al. (2001)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_069">Antoni, M. H., Lehman, J. M., Klibourn, K. M., Boyers, A. E., Culver, J. L., Alferi, S. M.,…Kilbourn, K. (2001).

Similar findings were found for older adults. After controlling for loneliness, marital status, economic status, and other correlates of health, Levy and Myers found that older adults with positive attitudes and higher self-efficacy had better health and lived on average almost 8 years longer than their more negative peers (Levy &amp; Myers, 2005; Levy, Slade, &amp; Kasl, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_072">Levy, B., &amp; Myers, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_s01_p03">Social support buffers us against stress in several ways.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_s02_p01">One difficulty that people face when trying to improve their happiness is that they may not always know what will make them happy. As one example, many of us think that if we just had more money we would be happier. While it is true that we do need money to afford food and adequate shelter for ourselves and our families, after this minimum level of wealth is reached, more money does not generally buy more happiness (Easterlin, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_082">Easterlin, R. (2005). Feeding the illusion of growth and happiness: A reply to Hagerty and Veenhoven. <em class="emphasis">Social Indicators Research, 74</em>(3), 429–443. doi:10.1007/s11205-004-6170-z</span> For instance, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s03_s02_f01">Figure 10.11 "Income and Happiness"</a>, even though income and material success has improved dramatically in many countries over the past decades, happiness has not. Despite tremendous economic growth in France, Japan, and the United States between 1946 to 1990, there was no increase in reports of well-being by the citizens of these countries. Americans today have about three times the buying power they had in the 1950s, and yet overall happiness has not increased. The problem seems to be that we never seem to have enough money to make us “really” happy. Csikszentmihalyi (1999)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_083">Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1999). If we are so rich, why aren’t we happy? <em class="emphasis">American Psychologist, 54</em>(10), 821–827.</span> reported that people who earned $30,000 per year felt that they would be happier if they made $50,000 per year, but that people who earned $100,000 per year said that they would need $250,000 per year to make them happy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_s02_p02">These findings might lead us to conclude that we don’t always know what does or what might make us happy, and this seems to be at least partially true. For instance, Jean Twenge and her colleagues (Twenge, Campbell &amp; Foster, 2003)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_084">Twenge, J. M., Campbell, W. K., &amp; Foster, C. A. (2003). Parenthood and marital satisfaction: A meta-analytic review. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marriage and Family, 65</em>(3), 574–583.</span> have found in several studies that although people with children frequently claim that having children makes them happy, couples who do not have children actually report being happier than those who do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_s02_p03">Psychologists have found that people’s ability to predict their future emotional states is not very accurate (Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_085">Wilson, T. D., &amp; Gilbert, D. T. (2005). Affective forecasting: Knowing what to want. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14</em>(3), 131–134.</span> For one, people overestimate their emotional reactions to events. Although people think that positive and negative events that might occur to them will make a huge difference in their lives, and although these changes do make at least some difference in life satisfaction, they tend to be less influential than we think they are going to be. Positive events tend to make us feel good, but their effects wear off pretty quickly, and the same is true for negative events. For instance, Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman (1978)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_086">Brickman, P., Coates, D., &amp; Janoff-Bulman, R. (1978). Lottery winners and accident victims: Is happiness relative? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36</em>(8), 917–927.</span> interviewed people who had won more than $50,000 in a lottery and found that they were not happier than they had been in the past, and were also not happier than a control group of similar people who had not won the lottery. On the other hand, the researchers found that individuals who were paralyzed as a result of accidents were not as unhappy as might be expected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_s02_p04">How can this possibly be? There are several reasons. For one, people are resilient; they bring their coping skills to play when negative events occur, and this makes them feel better. Secondly, most people do not continually experience very positive, or very negative, affect over a long period of time, but rather adapt to their current circumstances. Just as we enjoy the second chocolate bar we eat less than we enjoy the first, as we experience more and more positive outcomes in our daily lives we habituate to them and our life satisfaction returns to a more moderate level (Small, Zatorre, Dagher, Evans, &amp; Jones-Gotman, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_087">Small, D. M., Zatorre, R. J., Dagher, A., Evans, A. C., &amp; Jones-Gotman, M. (2001). Changes in brain activity related to eating chocolate: From pleasure to aversion. <em class="emphasis">Brain, 124</em>(9), 1720–1733.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_s02_p05">Another reason that we may mispredict our happiness is that our social comparisons change when our own status changes as a result of new events. People who are wealthy compare themselves to other wealthy people, people who are poor tend to compare with other poor people, and people who are ill tend to compare with other ill people, When our comparisons change, our happiness levels are correspondingly influenced. And when people are asked to predict their future emotions, they may focus only on the positive or negative event they are asked about, and forget about all the other things that won’t change. Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, and Axsom (2000)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_088">Wilson, T. D., Wheatley, T., Meyers, J. M., Gilbert, D. T., &amp; Axsom, D. (2000). Focalism: A source of durability bias in affective forecasting. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78</em>(5), 821–836.</span> found that when people were asked to focus on all the more regular things that they will still be doing in the future (working, going to church, socializing with family and friends, and so forth), their predictions about how something really good or bad would influence them were less extreme.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s03_s02_p06">If pleasure is fleeting, at least misery shares some of the same quality. We might think we can’t be happy if something terrible, such as the loss of a partner or child, were to happen to us, but after a period of adjustment most people find that happiness levels return to prior levels (Bonnano et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_089">Bonanno, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p01">Along with the need to drink fresh water, which humans can normally attain in all except the most extreme situations, the need for food is the most fundamental and important human need. More than 1 in 10 U.S. households contain people who live without enough nourishing food, and this lack of proper nourishment has profound effects on their abilities to create effective lives (Hunger Notes, n.d.).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_093">Hunger Notes.

Hungry people become listless and apathetic to save energy and then become completely obsessed with food. Ancel Keys and his colleagues (Keys, Brožek, Henschel, Mickelsen, &amp; Taylor, 1950)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_094">Keys, A., Brožek, J., Henschel, A., Mickelsen, O., &amp; Taylor, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p02">Like most interesting psychological phenomena, the simple behavior of eating has both biological and social determinants (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s04_s01_f01">Figure 10.12 "Biological, Psychological, and Social-Cultural Contributors to Eating"</a>). Biologically, hunger is controlled by the interactions among complex pathways in the nervous system and a variety of hormonal and chemical systems in the brain and body. The stomach is of course important. We feel more hungry when our stomach is empty than when it is full. But we can also feel hunger even without input from the stomach. Two areas of the hypothalamus are known to be particularly important in eating. The lateral part of the hypothalamus responds primarily to cues to start eating, whereas the ventromedial part of the hypothalamus primarily responds to cues to stop eating. If the lateral part of the hypothalamus is damaged, the animal will not eat even if food is present, whereas if the ventromedial part of the hypothalamus is damaged, the animal will eat until it is obese (Wolf &amp; Miller, 1964).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_095">Wolf, G., &amp; Miller, N.

Glucose levels in the bloodstream are regulated by <em class="emphasis">insulin</em>, a hormone secreted by the pancreas gland.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p04">Normally the interaction of the various systems that determine hunger creates a balance or <em class="emphasis">homeostasis</em> in which we eat when we are hungry and stop eating when we feel full. But homeostasis varies among people; some people simply weigh more than others, and there is little they can do to change their fundamental weight.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p05">How we eat is also influenced by our environment. When researchers rigged clocks to move faster, people got hungrier and ate more, as if they thought they must be hungry again because so much time had passed since they last ate (Schachter, 1968).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_097">Schachter, S.

Obesity and eating. <em class="emphasis">Science, 161</em>(3843), 751–756.</span> And if we forget that we have already eaten, we are likely to eat again even if we are not actually hungry (Rozin, Dow, Moscovitch, &amp; Rajaram, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_098">Rozin, P., Dow, S., Moscovitch, M., &amp; Rajaram, S.

The vast majority of human beings have a heterosexual orientation—their sexual desire is focused toward members of the opposite sex. A smaller minority is primarily homosexual (i.e., they have sexual desire for members of their own sex). Between 3% and 4% of men are gay, and between 1% and 2% of women are lesbian. Another 1% of the population reports being bisexual (having desires for both sexes). The love and sexual lives of homosexuals are little different from those of heterosexuals, except where their behaviors are constrained by cultural norms and local laws. As with heterosexuals, some gays and lesbians are celibate, some are promiscuous, but most are in committed, long-term relationships (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, &amp; Michaels, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_131">Laumann, E.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s02_s02_p03">Although homosexuality has been practiced as long as records of human behavior have been kept, and occurs in many animals at least as frequently as it does in humans, cultures nevertheless vary substantially in their attitudes toward it. In Western societies such as the United States and Europe, attitudes are becoming progressively more tolerant of homosexuality, but it remains unacceptable in many other parts of the world. The American Psychiatric Association no longer considers homosexuality to be a “mental illness,” although it did so until 1973. Because prejudice against gays and lesbians can lead to experiences of ostracism, depression, and even suicide (Kulkin, Chauvin, &amp; Percle, 2000),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_132">Kulkin, H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s02_s02_p04">Whether sexual orientation is driven more by nature or by nurture has received a great deal of research attention, and research has found that sexual orientation is primarily biological (Mustanski, Chivers, &amp; Bailey, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_133">Mustanski, B.

                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s02_s02_p05">Although smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs, engaging in unsafe sex, and eating too much may produce enjoyable positive emotions in the short term, they are some of the leading causes of negative health outcomes and even death in the long term (Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, &amp; Gerberding, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_137">Mokdad, A.

Poor diet and physical inactivity combine to make up the second greatest threat to our health. But we can improve our diet by eating more natural and less processed food, and by monitoring our food intake. And we can start and maintain an exercise program. Exercise keeps us happier, improves fitness, and leads to better health and lower mortality (Fogelholm, 2010; Galper, Trivedi, Barlow, Dunn, &amp; Kampert, 2006; Hassmén, Koivula, &amp; Uutela, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_139">Fogelholm, M.

About half of U.S. children under 18 report having had intercourse, a rate much higher than in other parts of the world. Although sex is fun, it can also kill us if we are not careful. Sexual activity can lead to guilt about having engaged in the act itself, and may also lead to unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV infection. Alcohol consumption also leads to risky sexual behavior. Sex partners who have been drinking are less likely to practice safe sex and have an increased risk of STIs, including HIV infection (Hutton, McCaul, Santora, &amp; Erbelding 2008; Raj et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_146">Hutton, H., McCaul, M., Santora, P., &amp; Erbelding, E.

<span class="title-prefix">10.5</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p01">Affect guides behavior, helps us make decisions, and has a major impact on our mental and physical health. Affect is guided by arousal—our experiences of the bodily responses created by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p02">Emotions are the mental and physiological feeling states that direct our attention and guide our behavior. The most fundamental emotions, known as the basic emotions, are those of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. A variety of secondary emotions are determined by the process of cognitive appraisal. The distinction between the primary and the secondary emotions is paralleled by two brain pathways: a fast pathway and a slow pathway.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p03">There are three primary theories of emotion, each supported by research evidence. The Cannon-Bard theory of emotion proposed that the experience of an emotion is accompanied by physiological arousal. The James-Lange theory of emotion proposes that our experience of an emotion is the result of the arousal that we experience. The two-factor theory of emotion asserts that the experience of emotion is determined by the intensity of the arousal we are experiencing, but that the cognitive appraisal of the situation determines what the emotion will be. When people incorrectly label the source of the arousal that they are experiencing, we say that they have misattributed their arousal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p04">We communicate and perceive emotion in part through nonverbal communication and through facial expressions. The facial feedback hypothesis proposes that we also experience emotion in part through our own facial expressions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p05">Stress refers to the physiological responses that occur when an organism fails to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats. When it is extreme or prolonged, stress can create substantial health problems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p06">The general adaptation syndrome describes the three phases of physiological change that occur in response to long-term stress: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Stress creates a long-term negative effect on the body by activating the HPA axis, which produces the stress hormone cortisol. The HPA reactions to persistent stress lead to a weakening of the immune system. Chronic stress is also a major contributor to heart disease.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p07">The stress that we experience in our everyday lives, including daily hassles, can be taxing. People who experience strong negative emotions as a result of these hassles exhibit more negative stress responses those who react in a less negative way.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p08">On average, men are more likely than are women to respond to stress by activating the fight-or-flight response, whereas women are more likely to respond using the tend-and-befriend response.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p09">Attempting to ignore or suppress our stressors is not effective, in part because it is difficult to do. It is healthier to let out the negative thoughts and feelings by expressing them, either to ourselves or to others. It is easier to respond to stress if we can interpret it in more positive ways—for instance, as a challenge rather than a threat.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p10">The ability to successfully control our emotions is known as emotion regulation. Regulating emotions takes effort, but the ability to do so can have important positive health outcomes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p11">The best antidote for stress is to think positively, have fun, and enjoy the company of others. People who express optimism, self-efficacy, and hardiness cope better with stress and experience better health overall. Happiness is determined in part by genetic factors such that some people are naturally happier than others, but it is also facilitated by social support—our positive social relationships with others.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p12">People do not often know what will make them happy. After a minimum level of wealth is reached, more money does not generally buy more happiness. Although people think that positive and negative events will make a huge difference in their lives, and although these changes do make at least some difference in life satisfaction, they tend to be less influential than we think they are going to be.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p13">A motivation is a driving force that initiates and directs behavior. Motivations are often considered in psychology in terms of drives and goals, with the goal of maintaining homeostasis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p14">Eating is a primary motivation determined by hormonal and social factors. Cultural norms about appropriate weights influence eating behaviors. The desire to be thin can lead to eating disorders including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p15">Uncontrolled obesity leads to health problems including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and some types of cancer. It is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide. The two approaches to controlling weight are eating less and exercising more.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p16">Sex is a fundamental motivation that involves the coordination of a wide variety of behaviors, including courtship, sex, household arrangements, parenting, and child care. The sexual response cycle is similar in men and women. The sex hormone testosterone is particularly important for sex drive, in both men and women.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p17">Sexual behavior varies widely, not only between men and women but within each sex.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s05_p18">The vast majority of human beings have a heterosexual orientation, but a smaller minority is primarily homosexual or bisexual. The love and sexual lives of homosexuals and bisexual are little different from those of heterosexuals, except where their behaviors are constrained by cultural norms and local laws.</p>
