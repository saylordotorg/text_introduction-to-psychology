    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_p01">Psychologists agree that if their ideas and theories about human behavior are to be taken seriously, they must be backed up by data. However, the research of different psychologists is designed with different goals in mind, and the different goals require different approaches. These varying approaches, summarized in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_t01">Table 2.2 "Characteristics of the Three Research Designs"</a>, are known as <em class="emphasis">research designs</em>.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Descriptive Research: Assessing the Current State of Affairs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p01">Descriptive research is designed to create a snapshot of the current thoughts, feelings, or behavior of individuals. This section reviews three types of descriptive research: <em class="emphasis">case studies</em>, <em class="emphasis">surveys</em>, and <em class="emphasis">naturalistic observation</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p02">Sometimes the data in a descriptive research project are based on only a small set of individuals, often only one person or a single small group. These research designs are known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">case studies</a><span class="glossdef">A descriptive record of one or more individual’s experiences and behavior.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">descriptive records of one or more individual’s experiences and behavior</em>. Sometimes case studies involve ordinary individuals, as when developmental psychologist Jean Piaget used his observation of his own children to develop his stage theory of cognitive development. More frequently, case studies are conducted on individuals who have unusual or abnormal experiences or characteristics or who find themselves in particularly difficult or stressful situations. The assumption is that by carefully studying individuals who are socially marginal, who are experiencing unusual situations, or who are going through a difficult phase in their lives, we can learn something about human nature.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p03">Sigmund Freud was a master of using the psychological difficulties of individuals to draw conclusions about basic psychological processes. Freud wrote case studies of some of his most interesting patients and used these careful examinations to develop his important theories of personality. One classic example is Freud’s description of “Little Hans,” a child whose fear of horses the psychoanalyst interpreted in terms of repressed sexual impulses and the Oedipus complex (Freud (1909/1964).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn02_018">Freud, S. (1964). Analysis of phobia in a five-year-old boy. In E. A. Southwell &amp; M. Merbaum (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Personality: Readings in theory and research</em> (pp. 3–32). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. (Original work published 1909)</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p04">Another well-known case study is Phineas Gage, a man whose thoughts and emotions were extensively studied by cognitive psychologists after a railroad spike was blasted through his skull in an accident. Although there is question about the interpretation of this case study (Kotowicz, 2007),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn02_019">Kotowicz, Z. (2007). The strange case of Phineas Gage. <em class="emphasis">History of the Human Sciences, 20</em>(1), 115–131.</span> it did provide early evidence that the brain’s frontal lobe is involved in emotion and morality (Damasio et al., 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn02_020">Damasio, H., Grabowski, T., Frank, R., Galaburda, A. M., Damasio, A. R., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Berntson, G. G. (2005). The return of Phineas Gage: Clues about the brain from the skull of a famous patient. In <em class="emphasis">Social neuroscience: Key readings.</em> (pp. 21–28). New York, NY: Psychology Press.</span> An interesting example of a case study in clinical psychology is described by Rokeach (1964),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn02_021">Rokeach, M. (1964). <em class="emphasis">The three Christs of Ypsilanti: A psychological study</em>. New York, NY: Knopf.</span> who investigated in detail the beliefs and interactions among three patients with schizophrenia, all of whom were convinced they were Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p05">In other cases the data from descriptive research projects come in the form of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">survey</a><span class="glossdef">A measure administered either through interviews or written questionnaires to get a picture of the beliefs or behaviors of a sample of people of interest.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a measure administered through either an interview or a written questionnaire to get a picture of the beliefs or behaviors of a sample of people of interest</em>. <em class="emphasis">The people chosen to participate in the research</em> (known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sample</a><span class="glossdef">The people chosen to participate in a research project.</span></span>) are selected to be representative of <em class="emphasis">all the people that the researcher wishes to know about</em> (the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">population</a><span class="glossdef">In a descriptive research design, the people that the researcher wishes to know about.</span></span>). In election polls, for instance, a sample is taken from the population of all “likely voters” in the upcoming elections.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p06">The results of surveys may sometimes be rather mundane, such as “Nine out of ten doctors prefer Tymenocin,” or “The median income in Montgomery County is $36,712.” Yet other times (particularly in discussions of social behavior), the results can be shocking: “More than 40,000 people are killed by gunfire in the United States every year,” or “More than 60% of women between the ages of 50 and 60 suffer from depression.” Descriptive research is frequently used by psychologists to get an estimate of the prevalence (or <em class="emphasis">incidence</em>) of psychological disorders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p07">A final type of descriptive research—known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">naturalistic observation</a><span class="glossdef">Research based on the observation of everyday events.</span></span>—is <em class="emphasis">research based on the observation of everyday events</em>. For instance, a developmental psychologist who watches children on a playground and describes what they say to each other while they play is conducting descriptive research, as is a biopsychologist who observes animals in their natural habitats. One example of observational research involves a systematic procedure known as the <em class="emphasis">strange situation</em>, used to get a picture of how adults and young children interact. The data that are collected in the strange situation are systematically coded in a coding sheet such as that shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s01_t01">Table 2.3 "Sample Coding Form Used to Assess Child’s and Mother’s Behavior in the Strange Situation"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para">The distribution of the heights of the students in a class will form a normal distribution. In this sample the mean (<em class="emphasis">M</em>) = 67.12 and the standard deviation (<em class="emphasis">s</em>) = 2.74.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p09">A distribution can be described in terms of its <em class="emphasis">central tendency</em>—that is, the point in the distribution around which the data are centered—and its <em class="emphasis">dispersion</em>, or spread. The arithmetic average, or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">arithmetic mean</a><span class="glossdef">Symbolized by the letter <em class="emphasis">M</em>, the most commonly used measure of central tendency.</span></span>, is <em class="emphasis">the most commonly used measure of central tendency</em>. It is computed by calculating the sum of all the scores of the variable and dividing this sum by the number of participants in the distribution (denoted by the letter <em class="emphasis">N</em>). In the data presented in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s01_f02">Figure 2.5 "Height Distribution"</a>, the mean height of the students is 67.12 inches. The sample mean is usually indicated by the letter <em class="emphasis">M</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p10">In some cases, however, the data distribution is not symmetrical. This occurs when there are one or more extreme scores (known as <em class="emphasis">outliers</em>) at one end of the distribution. Consider, for instance, the variable of family income (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s01_f03">Figure 2.6 "Family Income Distribution"</a>), which includes an outlier (a value of $3,800,000). In this case the mean is not a good measure of central tendency. Although it appears from <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s01_f03">Figure 2.6 "Family Income Distribution"</a> that the central tendency of the family income variable should be around $70,000, the mean family income is actually $223,960. The single very extreme income has a disproportionate impact on the mean, resulting in a value that does not well represent the central tendency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p11">The <em class="emphasis">median</em> is used as an alternative measure of central tendency when distributions are not symmetrical. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">median</a><span class="glossdef">The score in the center of the distribution, meaning that 50% of the scores are greater than the median and 50% of the scores are less than the median.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the score in the center of the distribution, meaning that 50% of the scores are greater than the median and 50% of the scores are less than the median</em>. In our case, the median household income ($73,000) is a much better indication of central tendency than is the mean household income ($223,960).</p>

            <p class="para">The distribution of family incomes is likely to be nonsymmetrical because some incomes can be very large in comparison to most incomes. In this case the median or the mode is a better indicator of central tendency than is the mean.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p12">A final measure of central tendency, known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mode</a><span class="glossdef">The value or values that occur most frequently in a variable’s distribution.</span></span>, represents <em class="emphasis">the value that occurs most frequently in the distribution</em>. You can see from <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s01_f03">Figure 2.6 "Family Income Distribution"</a> that the mode for the family income variable is $93,000 (it occurs four times).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p13">In addition to summarizing the central tendency of a distribution, descriptive statistics convey information about how the scores of the variable are spread around the central tendency. <em class="emphasis">Dispersion</em> refers to the extent to which the scores are all tightly clustered around the central tendency, like this:</p>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_f04">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.7</span> </p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p14">Or they may be more spread out away from it, like this:</p>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_f05">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.8</span> </p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p15">One simple measure of dispersion is to find the largest (the <em class="emphasis">maximum</em>) and the smallest (the <em class="emphasis">minimum</em>) observed values of the variable and to compute the <em class="emphasis">range</em> of the variable as the maximum observed score minus the minimum observed score. You can check that the range of the height variable in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s01_f02">Figure 2.5 "Height Distribution"</a> is 72 – 62 = 10. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">standard deviation</a><span class="glossdef">Symbolized by the letter <em class="emphasis">s</em>, the most commonly used measure of the dispersion of a variable’s distribution.</span></span>, symbolized as <em class="emphasis">s</em>, is <em class="emphasis">the most commonly used measure of dispersion</em>. Distributions with a larger standard deviation have more spread. The standard deviation of the height variable is <em class="emphasis">s</em> = 2.74, and the standard deviation of the family income variable is <em class="emphasis">s</em> = $745,337.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p16">An advantage of descriptive research is that it attempts to capture the complexity of everyday behavior. Case studies provide detailed information about a single person or a small group of people, surveys capture the thoughts or reported behaviors of a large population of people, and naturalistic observation objectively records the behavior of people or animals as it occurs naturally. Thus descriptive research is used to provide a relatively complete understanding of what is currently happening.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s01_p17">Despite these advantages, descriptive research has a distinct disadvantage in that, although it allows us to get an idea of what is currently happening, it is usually limited to static pictures. Although descriptions of particular experiences may be interesting, they are not always transferable to other individuals in other situations, nor do they tell us exactly why specific behaviors or events occurred. For instance, descriptions of individuals who have suffered a stressful event, such as a war or an earthquake, can be used to understand the individuals’ reactions to the event but cannot tell us anything about the long-term effects of the stress. And because there is no comparison group that did not experience the stressful situation, we cannot know what these individuals would be like if they hadn’t had the stressful experience.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Correlational Research: Seeking Relationships Among Variables</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p01">In contrast to descriptive research, which is designed primarily to provide static pictures, correlational research involves the measurement of two or more relevant variables and an assessment of the relationship between or among those variables. For instance, the variables of height and weight are systematically related (correlated) because taller people generally weigh more than shorter people. In the same way, study time and memory errors are also related, because the more time a person is given to study a list of words, the fewer errors he or she will make. When there are two variables in the research design, one of them is called the <em class="emphasis">predictor variable</em> and the other the <em class="emphasis">outcome variable</em>. The research design can be visualized like this, where the curved arrow represents the expected correlation between the two variables:</p>
        <div class="figure large block">

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p02">One way of organizing the data from a correlational study with two variables is to graph the values of each of the measured variables using a <em class="emphasis">scatter plot</em>. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s02_f01">Figure 2.10 "Examples of Scatter Plots"</a>, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scatter plot</a><span class="glossdef">A visual image of the relationship between two variables.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a visual image of the relationship between two variables</em>. A point is plotted for each individual at the intersection of his or her scores for the two variables. When the association between the variables on the scatter plot can be easily approximated with a straight line, as in parts (a) and (b) of <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s02_f01">Figure 2.10 "Examples of Scatter Plots"</a>, the variables are said to have a <em class="emphasis">linear relationship</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p03">When the straight line indicates that individuals who have above-average values for one variable also tend to have above-average values for the other variable, as in part (a), the relationship is said to be <em class="emphasis">positive linear</em>. Examples of positive linear relationships include those between height and weight, between education and income, and between age and mathematical abilities in children. In each case people who score higher on one of the variables also tend to score higher on the other variable. <em class="emphasis">Negative linear relationships</em>, in contrast, as shown in part (b), occur when above-average values for one variable tend to be associated with below-average values for the other variable. Examples of negative linear relationships include those between the age of a child and the number of diapers the child uses, and between practice on and errors made on a learning task. In these cases people who score higher on one of the variables tend to score lower on the other variable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p04">Relationships between variables that cannot be described with a straight line are known as <em class="emphasis">nonlinear relationships</em>. Part (c) of <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s02_f01">Figure 2.10 "Examples of Scatter Plots"</a> shows a common pattern in which the distribution of the points is essentially random. In this case there is no relationship at all between the two variables, and they are said to be <em class="emphasis">independent</em>. Parts (d) and (e) of <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s02_f01">Figure 2.10 "Examples of Scatter Plots"</a> show patterns of association in which, although there is an association, the points are not well described by a single straight line. For instance, part (d) shows the type of relationship that frequently occurs between anxiety and performance. Increases in anxiety from low to moderate levels are associated with performance increases, whereas increases in anxiety from moderate to high levels are associated with decreases in performance. Relationships that change in direction and thus are not described by a single straight line are called <em class="emphasis">curvilinear relationships</em>.</p>

Positive values of <em class="emphasis">r</em> (such as <em class="emphasis">r</em> = .54 or <em class="emphasis">r</em> = .67) indicate that the relationship is positive linear (i.e., the pattern of the dots on the scatter plot runs from the lower left to the upper right), whereas negative values of <em class="emphasis">r</em> (such as <em class="emphasis">r</em> = –.30 or <em class="emphasis">r</em> = –.72) indicate negative linear relationships (i.e., the dots run from the upper left to the lower right). The strength of the linear relationship is indexed by the distance of the correlation coefficient from zero (its absolute value). For instance, <em class="emphasis">r</em> = –.54 is a stronger relationship than <em class="emphasis">r</em> = .30, and <em class="emphasis">r</em> = .72 is a stronger relationship than <em class="emphasis">r</em> = –.57. Because the Pearson correlation coefficient only measures linear relationships, variables that have curvilinear relationships are not well described by <em class="emphasis">r</em>, and the observed correlation will be close to zero.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p06">It is also possible to study relationships among more than two measures at the same time. A research design in which more than one predictor variable is used to predict a single outcome variable is analyzed through <em class="emphasis">multiple regression</em> (Aiken &amp; West, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn02_023">Aiken, L., &amp; West, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p07">An important limitation of correlational research designs is that they cannot be used to draw conclusions about the causal relationships among the measured variables. Consider, for instance, a researcher who has hypothesized that viewing violent behavior will cause increased aggressive play in children. He has collected, from a sample of fourth-grade children, a measure of how many violent television shows each child views during the week, as well as a measure of how aggressively each child plays on the school playground. From his collected data, the researcher discovers a positive correlation between the two measured variables.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p08">Although this positive correlation appears to support the researcher’s hypothesis, it cannot be taken to indicate that viewing violent television causes aggressive behavior. Although the researcher is tempted to assume that viewing violent television causes aggressive play,</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p09">there are other possibilities. One alternate possibility is that the causal direction is exactly opposite from what has been hypothesized. Perhaps children who have behaved aggressively at school develop residual excitement that leads them to want to watch violent television shows at home:</p>
        <div class="figure large block">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.2.2</span> </p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p10">Although this possibility may seem less likely, there is no way to rule out the possibility of such reverse causation on the basis of this observed correlation. It is also possible that both causal directions are operating and that the two variables cause each other:</p>
        <div class="figure large block">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.2.2</span> </p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p11">Still another possible explanation for the observed correlation is that it has been produced by the presence of a <em class="emphasis">common-causal variable</em> (also known as a <em class="emphasis">third variable</em>). A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">common-causal variable</a><span class="glossdef">A variable that is not part of the research hypothesis but that causes both the predictor and the outcome variable and thus produces the observed correlation between them.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a variable that is not part of the research hypothesis but that causes both the predictor and the outcome variable and thus produces the observed correlation between them</em>. In our example a potential common-causal variable is the discipline style of the children’s parents. Parents who use a harsh and punitive discipline style may produce children who both like to watch violent television and who behave aggressively in comparison to children whose parents use less harsh discipline:</p>
        <div class="figure large block">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.2.2</span> </p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p12">In this case, television viewing and aggressive play would be positively correlated (as indicated by the curved arrow between them), even though neither one caused the other but they were both caused by the discipline style of the parents (the straight arrows). When the predictor and outcome variables are both caused by a common-causal variable, the observed relationship between them is said to be <em class="emphasis">spurious</em>. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spurious relationship</a><span class="glossdef">A relationship between two variables in which a common-causal variable produces and “explains away” the relationship.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a relationship between two variables in which a common-causal variable produces and “explains away” the relationship</em>. If effects of the common-causal variable were taken away, or controlled for, the relationship between the predictor and outcome variables would disappear. In the example the relationship between aggression and television viewing might be spurious because by controlling for the effect of the parents’ disciplining style, the relationship between television viewing and aggressive behavior might go away.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p13">Common-causal variables in correlational research designs can be thought of as “mystery” variables because, as they have not been measured, their presence and identity are usually unknown to the researcher. Since it is not possible to measure every variable that could cause both the predictor and outcome variables, the existence of an unknown common-causal variable is always a possibility. For this reason, we are left with the basic limitation of correlational research: Correlation does not demonstrate causation. It is important that when you read about correlational research projects, you keep in mind the possibility of spurious relationships, and be sure to interpret the findings appropriately. Although correlational research is sometimes reported as demonstrating causality without any mention being made of the possibility of reverse causation or common-causal variables, informed consumers of research, like you, are aware of these interpretational problems.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s02_p14">In sum, correlational research designs have both strengths and limitations. One strength is that they can be used when experimental research is not possible because the predictor variables cannot be manipulated. Correlational designs also have the advantage of allowing the researcher to study behavior as it occurs in everyday life. And we can also use correlational designs to make predictions—for instance, to predict from the scores on their battery of tests the success of job trainees during a training session. But we cannot use such correlational information to determine whether the training caused better job performance. For that, researchers rely on experiments.</p>

E. (2000). Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78</em>(4), 772–790.</span> The study was designed to test the hypothesis that viewing violent video games would increase aggressive behavior. In this research, male and female undergraduates from Iowa State University were given a chance to play with either a violent video game (Wolfenstein 3D) or a nonviolent video game (Myst). During the experimental session, the participants played their assigned video games for 15 minutes. Then, after the play, each participant played a competitive game with an opponent in which the participant could deliver blasts of white noise through the earphones of the opponent. The operational definition of the dependent variable (aggressive behavior) was the level and duration of noise delivered to the opponent. The design of the experiment is shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch02_s02_s03_f01">Figure 2.17 "An Experimental Research Design"</a>.</p>

                <p class="para">Two advantages of the experimental research design are (1) the assurance that the independent variable (also known as the experimental manipulation) occurs prior to the measured dependent variable, and (2) the creation of initial equivalence between the conditions of the experiment (in this case by using random assignment to conditions).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s03_p03">Experimental designs have two very nice features. For one, they guarantee that the independent variable occurs prior to the measurement of the dependent variable. This eliminates the possibility of reverse causation. Second, the influence of common-causal variables is controlled, and thus eliminated, by creating <em class="emphasis">initial equivalence</em> among the participants in each of the experimental conditions before the manipulation occurs.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s03_p04">The most common method of creating equivalence among the experimental conditions is through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">random assignment to conditions</a><span class="glossdef">A procedure used in experimental research designs in which the condition that each participant is assigned to is determined through a random process.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a procedure in which the condition that each participant is assigned to is determined through a random process, such as drawing numbers out of an envelope or using a random number table</em>. Anderson and Dill first randomly assigned about 100 participants to each of their two groups (Group A and Group B). Because they used random assignment to conditions, they could be confident that, before the experimental manipulation occurred, the students in Group A were, on average, equivalent to the students in Group B on every possible variable, including variables that are likely to be related to aggression, such as parental discipline style, peer relationships, hormone levels, diet—and in fact everything else.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s03_p05">Then, after they had created initial equivalence, Anderson and Dill created the experimental manipulation—they had the participants in Group A play the violent game and the participants in Group B play the nonviolent game. Then they compared the dependent variable (the white noise blasts) between the two groups, finding that the students who had viewed the violent video game gave significantly longer noise blasts than did the students who had played the nonviolent game.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s03_p06">Anderson and Dill had from the outset created initial equivalence between the groups. This initial equivalence allowed them to observe differences in the white noise levels between the two groups after the experimental manipulation, leading to the conclusion that it was the independent variable (and not some other variable) that caused these differences. The idea is that the only thing that was different between the students in the two groups was the video game they had played.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch02_s02_s03_p07">Despite the advantage of determining causation, experiments do have limitations. One is that they are often conducted in laboratory situations rather than in the everyday lives of people. Therefore, we do not know whether results that we find in a laboratory setting will necessarily hold up in everyday life. Second, and more important, is that some of the most interesting and key social variables cannot be experimentally manipulated. If we want to study the influence of the size of a mob on the destructiveness of its behavior, or to compare the personality characteristics of people who join suicide cults with those of people who do not join such cults, these relationships must be assessed using correlational designs, because it is simply not possible to experimentally manipulate these variables.</p>
