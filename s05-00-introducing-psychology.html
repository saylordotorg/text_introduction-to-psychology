<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 1</span> Introducing Psychology</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Psychology</a><span class="glossdef">The scientific study of mind and behavior.</span></span> is the <em class="emphasis">scientific study of mind and behavior</em>. The word “psychology” comes from the Greek words “psyche,” meaning <em class="emphasis">life</em>, and “logos,” meaning <em class="emphasis">explanation</em>. Psychology is a popular major for students, a popular topic in the public media, and a part of our everyday lives. Television shows such as <em class="emphasis">Dr. Phil</em> feature psychologists who provide personal advice to those with personal or family difficulties. Crime dramas such as <em class="emphasis">CSI</em>, <em class="emphasis">Lie to Me</em>, and others feature the work of forensic psychologists who use psychological principles to help solve crimes. And many people have direct knowledge about psychology because they have visited psychologists, for instance, school counselors, family therapists, and religious, marriage, or bereavement counselors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_p02">Because we are frequently exposed to the work of psychologists in our everyday lives, we all have an idea about what psychology is and what psychologists do. In many ways I am sure that your conceptions are correct. Psychologists do work in forensic fields, and they do provide counseling and therapy for people in distress. But there are hundreds of thousands of psychologists in the world, and most of them work in other places, doing work that you are probably not aware of.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_p03">Most psychologists work in research laboratories, hospitals, and other field settings where they study the behavior of humans and animals. For instance, my colleagues in the Psychology Department at the University of Maryland study such diverse topics as anxiety in children, the interpretation of dreams, the effects of caffeine on thinking, how birds recognize each other, how praying mantises hear, how people from different cultures react differently in negotiation, and the factors that lead people to engage in terrorism. Other psychologists study such topics as alcohol and drug addiction, memory, emotion, hypnosis, love, what makes people aggressive or helpful, and the psychologies of politics, prejudice, culture, and religion. Psychologists also work in schools and businesses, and they use a variety of methods, including observation, questionnaires, interviews, and laboratory studies, to help them understand behavior.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_p04">This chapter provides an introduction to the broad field of psychology and the many approaches that psychologists take to understanding human behavior. We will consider how psychologists conduct scientific research, with an overview of some of the most important approaches used and topics studied by psychologists, and also consider the variety of fields in which psychologists work and the careers that are available to people with psychology degrees. I expect that you may find that at least some of your preconceptions about psychology will be challenged and changed, and you will learn that psychology is a field that will provide you with new ways of thinking about your own thoughts, feelings, and actions.</p>
