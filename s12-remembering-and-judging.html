        <h3 class="title">She Was Certain, but She Was Wrong</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p01">In 1984 Jennifer Thompson was a 22-year-old college student in North Carolina. One night a man broke into her apartment, put a knife to her throat, and raped her. According to her own account, Ms. Thompson studied her rapist throughout the incident with great determination to memorize his face. She said:</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch08_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p02">I studied every single detail on the rapist’s face. I looked at his hairline; I looked for scars, for tattoos, for anything that would help me identify him. When and if I survived.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p03">Ms. Thompson went to the police that same day to create a sketch of her attacker, relying on what she believed was her detailed memory. Several days later, the police constructed a photographic lineup. Thompson identified Ronald Cotton as the rapist, and she later testified against him at trial. She was positive it was him, with no doubt in her mind.</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch08_bl02">
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p04">I was sure. I knew it. I had picked the right guy, and he was going to go to jail. If there was the possibility of a death sentence, I wanted him to die. I wanted to flip the switch.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p05">As positive as she was, it turned out that Jennifer Thompson was wrong. But it was not until after Mr. Cotton had served 11 years in prison for a crime he did not commit that conclusive DNA evidence indicated that Bobby Poole was the actual rapist, and Cotton was released from jail. Jennifer Thompson’s memory had failed her, resulting in a substantial injustice. It took definitive DNA testing to shake her confidence, but she now knows that despite her confidence in her identification, it was wrong. Consumed by guilt, Thompson sought out Cotton when he was released from prison, and they have since become friends (Innocence Project, n.d.; Thompson, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_001">Innocence Project.

Over the past 10 years, almost 400 people have been released from prison when DNA evidence confirmed that they could not have committed the crime for which they had been convicted.

It is useful to consider memory and cognition in the same chapter because they work together to help us interpret and understand our environments.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p08">Memory and cognition represent the two major interests of cognitive psychologists. The cognitive approach became the most important school of psychology during the 1960s, and the field of psychology has remained in large part cognitive since that time. The cognitive school was influenced in large part by the development of the electronic computer, and although the differences between computers and the human mind are vast, cognitive psychologists have used the computer as a model for understanding the workings of the mind.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Differences between Brains and Computers</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch08_l01">
            <li>In computers, information can be accessed only if one knows the exact location of the memory. In the brain, information can be accessed through <em class="emphasis">spreading activation</em> from closely related concepts.</li>
            <li>The brain operates primarily in parallel, meaning that it is multitasking on many different actions at the same time. Although this is changing as new computers are developed, most computers are primarily serial—they finish one task before they start another.</li>
            <li>In computers, short-term (random-access) memory is a subset of long-term (read-only) memory. In the brain, the processes of short-term memory and long-term memory are distinct.</li>
            <li>In the brain, there is no difference between hardware (the mechanical aspects of the computer) and software (the programs that run on the hardware).</li>
            <li>In the brain, synapses, which operate using an electrochemical process, are much slower but also vastly more complex and useful than the transistors used by computers.</li>
            <li>Computers differentiate memory (e.g., the hard drive) from processing (the central processing unit), but in brains there is no such distinction. In the brain (but not in computers) existing memory is used to interpret and store incoming information, and retrieving information from memory changes the memory itself.</li>
            <li>The brain is self-organizing and self-repairing, but computers are not. If a person suffers a stroke, neural plasticity will help him or her recover. If we drop our laptop and it breaks, it cannot fix itself.</li>
            <li>The brain is significantly bigger than any current computer. The brain is estimated to have 25,000,000,000,000,000 (25 million billion) interactions among axons, dendrites, neurons, and neurotransmitters, and that doesn’t include the approximately 1 trillion glial cells that may also be important for information processing and memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p09">Although cognitive psychology began in earnest at about the same time that the electronic computer was first being developed, and although cognitive psychologists have frequently used the computer as a model for understanding how the brain operates, research in cognitive neuroscience has revealed many important differences between brains and computers. The neuroscientist Chris Chatham (2007)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_003">Chatham, C.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p10">We will begin the chapter with the study of memory. Our memories allow us to do relatively simple things, such as remembering where we parked our car or the name of the current president of the United States, but also allow us to form complex memories, such as how to ride a bicycle or to write a computer program. Moreover, our memories define us as individuals—they are our experiences, our relationships, our successes, and our failures. Without our memories, we would not have a life.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p11">At least for some things, our memory is very good (Bahrick, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_004">Bahrick, H. P. (2000).

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p13">In this chapter we will see how psychologists use behavioral responses (such as memory tests and reaction times) to draw inferences about what and how people remember. And we will see that although we have very good memory for some things, our memories are far from perfect (Schacter, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_008">Schacter, D. L. (1996). <em class="emphasis">Searching for memory: The brain, the mind, and the past</em> (1st ed.). New York, NY: Basic Books.</span> The errors that we make are due to the fact that our memories are not simply recording devices that input, store, and retrieve the world around us. Rather, we actively process and interpret information as we remember and recollect it, and these cognitive processes influence what we remember and how we remember it. Because memories are constructed, not recorded, when we remember events we don’t reproduce exact replicas of those events (Bartlett, 1932).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_009">Bartlett, F. C. (1932). <em class="emphasis">Remembering</em>. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p14">In the last section of the chapter we will focus primarily on cognition, with a particular consideration for cases in which cognitive processes lead us to distort our judgments or misremember information. We will see that our prior knowledge can influence our memory. People who read the words “<em class="emphasis">dream</em>, <em class="emphasis">sheets</em>, <em class="emphasis">rest</em>, <em class="emphasis">snore</em>, <em class="emphasis">blanket</em>, <em class="emphasis">tired</em>, and <em class="emphasis">bed</em>” and then are asked to remember the words often think that they saw the word <em class="emphasis">sleep</em> even though that word was not in the list (Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_010">Roediger, H. L., &amp; McDermott, K. B. (1995). Creating false memories: Remembering words not presented in lists. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21</em>(4), 803–814.</span> And we will see that in other cases we are influenced by the ease with which we can retrieve information from memory or by the information that we are exposed to after we first learn something.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p15">Although much research in the area of memory and cognition is basic in orientation, the work also has profound influence on our everyday experiences. Our cognitive processes influence the accuracy and inaccuracy of our memories and our judgments, and they lead us to be vulnerable to the types of errors that eyewitnesses such as Jennifer Thompson may make. Understanding these potential errors is the first step in learning to avoid them.</p>

Recall, such as required on essay tests, involves two steps: first generating an answer and then determining whether it seems to be the correct one. Recognition, as on multiple-choice test, only involves determining which item from a list seems most correct (Haist, Shimamura, &amp; Squire, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_012">Haist, F., Shimamura, A.

If you have taken some French courses in the past, for instance, you might have forgotten most of the vocabulary you learned. But if you were to work on your French again, you’d learn the vocabulary much faster the second time around. Relearning can be a more sensitive measure of memory than either recall or recognition because it allows assessing memory in terms of “how much” or “how fast” rather than simply “correct” versus “incorrect” responses. Relearning also allows us to measure memory for procedures like driving a car or playing a piano piece, as well as memory for facts and figures.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Implicit Memory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p01">While explicit memory consists of the things that we can consciously report that we know, implicit memory refers to knowledge that we cannot consciously access. However, implicit memory is nevertheless exceedingly important to us because it has a direct effect on our behavior. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Implicit memory</a><span class="glossdef">The influence of experience on behavior, even if the individual is not aware of those influences.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the influence of experience on behavior, even if the individual is not aware of those influences</em>. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s01_s01_f01">Figure 8.2 "Types of Memory"</a>, there are three general types of implicit memory: procedural memory, classical conditioning effects, and priming.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Procedural memory</a><span class="glossdef">Implicit memory about our often unexplainable knowledge of how to do things.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">our often unexplainable knowledge of how to do things</em>. When we walk from one place to another, speak to another person in English, dial a cell phone, or play a video game, we are using procedural memory. Procedural memory allows us to perform complex tasks, even though we may not be able to explain to others how we do them. There is no way to tell someone how to ride a bicycle; a person has to learn by doing it. The idea of implicit memory helps explain how infants are able to learn. The ability to crawl, walk, and talk are procedures, and these skills are easily and efficiently developed while we are children despite the fact that as adults we have no conscious memory of having learned them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p03">A second type of implicit memory is classical conditioning effects, in which we learn, often without effort or awareness, to associate neutral stimuli (such as a sound or a light) with another stimulus (such as food), which creates a naturally occurring response, such as enjoyment or salivation. The memory for the association is demonstrated when the conditioned stimulus (the sound) begins to create the same response as the unconditioned stimulus (the food) did before the learning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p04">The final type of implicit memory is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priming</a><span class="glossdef">Changes in behavior as a result of experiences that have happened frequently or recently.</span></span>, or <em class="emphasis">changes in behavior as a result of experiences that have happened frequently or recently</em>. Priming refers both to the activation of knowledge (e.g., we can prime the concept of “kindness” by presenting people with words related to kindness) and to the influence of that activation on behavior (people who are primed with the concept of kindness may act more kindly).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p05">One measure of the influence of priming on implicit memory is the <em class="emphasis">word fragment test</em>, in which a person is asked to fill in missing letters to make words. You can try this yourself: First, try to complete the following word fragments, but work on each one for only three or four seconds. Do any words pop into mind quickly?</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p11">“He got his materials from the shelves, checked them out, and then left the building.”</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p12">Then try again to make words out of the word fragments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p13">I think you might find that it is easier to complete fragments 1 and 3 as “library” and “book,” respectively, after you read the sentence than it was before you read it. However, reading the sentence didn’t really help you to complete fragments 2 and 4 as “physician” and “chaise.” This difference in implicit memory probably occurred because as you read the sentence, the concept of “library” (and perhaps “book”) was primed, even though they were never mentioned explicitly. Once a concept is primed it influences our behaviors, for instance, on word fragment tests.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p14">Our everyday behaviors are influenced by priming in a wide variety of situations. Seeing an advertisement for cigarettes may make us start smoking, seeing the flag of our home country may arouse our patriotism, and seeing a student from a rival school may arouse our competitive spirit. And these influences on our behaviors may occur without our being aware of them.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p15">One of the most important characteristics of implicit memories is that they are frequently formed and used <em class="emphasis">automatically</em>, without much effort or awareness on our part.

Furthermore, for half of the research participants, the words were related to stereotypes of the elderly. These participants saw words such as the following:</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p18">The other half of the research participants also made sentences, but from words that had nothing to do with elderly stereotypes.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p19">The experimenters then assessed whether the priming of elderly stereotypes would have any effect on the students’ behavior—and indeed it did. When the research participant had gathered all of his or her belongings, thinking that the experiment was over, the experimenter thanked him or her for participating and gave directions to the closest elevator. Then, without the participants knowing it, the experimenters recorded the amount of time that the participant spent walking from the doorway of the experimental room toward the elevator. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s01_s02_f01">Figure 8.3 "Results From Bargh, Chen, and Burrows, 1996"</a>, participants who had made sentences using words related to elderly stereotypes took on the behaviors of the elderly—they walked significantly more slowly as they left the experimental room.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p04">To accomplish this difficult task you need to use a variety of skills. You clearly need to use STM, as you must keep the letters in storage until you are asked to list them. But you also need a way to make the best use of your available attention and processing. For instance, you might decide to use a strategy of “repeat the letters twice, then quickly solve the next problem, and then repeat the letters twice again including the new one.” Keeping this strategy (or others like it) going is the role of working memory’s <em class="emphasis">central executive</em>—the part of working memory that directs attention and processing. The central executive will make use of whatever strategies seem to be best for the given task. For instance, the central executive will direct the rehearsal process, and at the same time direct the visual cortex to form an image of the list of letters in memory.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p06">One way to prevent the decay of information from short-term memory is to use working memory to rehearse it. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Maintenance rehearsal</a><span class="glossdef">The process of repeating information mentally or out loud with the goal of keeping it in short-term memory.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the process of repeating information mentally or out loud with the goal of keeping it in memory</em>. We engage in maintenance rehearsal to keep a something that we want to remember (e.g., a person’s name, e-mail address, or phone number) in mind long enough to write it down, use it, or potentially transfer it to long-term memory.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p07">If we continue to rehearse information it will stay in STM until we stop rehearsing it, but there is also a capacity limit to STM. Try reading each of the following rows of numbers, one row at a time, at a rate of about one number each second. Then when you have finished each row, close your eyes and write down as many of the numbers as you can remember.</p>

I bet you missed some of the numbers in the last three rows, and did pretty poorly on the last one.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p17">The digit span of most adults is between five and nine digits, with an average of about seven. The cognitive psychologist George Miller (1956)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_022">Miller, G. A. (1956). The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 63</em>(2), 81–97.</span> referred to “seven plus or minus two” pieces of information as the “magic number” in short-term memory. But if we can only hold a maximum of about nine digits in short-term memory, then how can we remember larger amounts of information than this? For instance, how can we ever remember a 10-digit phone number long enough to dial it?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p18">One way we are able to expand our ability to remember things in STM is by using a memory technique called <em class="emphasis">chunking</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Chunking</a><span class="glossdef">The process of organizing information into smaller groupings (chunks), thereby increasing the number of items that can be held in short-term memory.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the process of organizing information into smaller groupings (chunks), thereby increasing the number of items that can be held in STM</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p23">Would it help you if I pointed out that the material in this string could be chunked into four sets of three letters each? I think it would, because then rather than remembering 12 letters, you would only have to remember the names of four television stations. In this case, chunking changes the number of items you have to remember from 12 to only four.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p24">Experts rely on chunking to help them process complex information.

Skill in chess. <em class="emphasis">American Scientist, 61</em>(4), 394–403.</span> showed chess masters and chess novices various positions of pieces on a chessboard for a few seconds each. The experts did a lot better than the novices in remembering the positions because they were able to see the “big picture.” They didn’t have to remember the position of each of the pieces individually, but chunked the pieces into several larger layouts. But when the researchers showed both groups random chess positions—positions that would be very unlikely to occur in real games—both groups did equally poorly, because in this situation the experts lost their ability to organize the layouts (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_f02">Figure 8.7 "Possible and Impossible Chess Positions"</a>). The same occurs for basketball. Basketball players recall actual basketball positions much better than do nonplayers, but only when the positions make sense in terms of what is happening on the court, or what is likely to happen in the near future, and thus can be chunked into bigger units (Didierjean &amp; Marmèche, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_024">Didierjean, A., &amp; Marmèche, E.

Rather than simply trying to remember the schools and their characteristics, you might try to relate the information to things you already know. For instance, you might try to remember the fundamentals of the cognitive school of psychology by linking the characteristics to the computer model. The cognitive school focuses on how information is input, processed, and retrieved, and you might think about how computers do pretty much the same thing. You might also try to organize the information into meaningful units. For instance, you might link the cognitive school to structuralism because both were concerned with mental processes. You also might try to use visual cues to help you remember the information. You might look at the image of Freud and imagine what he looked like as a child. That image might help you remember that childhood experiences were an important part of Freudian theory. Each person has his or her unique way of elaborating on information; the important thing is to try to develop unique and meaningful associations among the materials.</p>

After completing the specified task, each participant was asked to recall as many adjectives as he or she could remember.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s01_p07">Rogers and his colleagues hypothesized that different types of processing would have different effects on memory. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s02_s01_f02">Figure 8.9 "Self-Reference Effect Results"</a>, the students in the self-reference task condition recalled significantly more adjectives than did students in any other condition. This finding, known as the <em class="emphasis">self-reference effect</em>, is powerful evidence that the self-concept helps us organize and remember information. The next time you are studying for an exam, you might try relating the material to your own experiences. The self-reference effect suggests that doing so will help you better remember the information (Symons &amp; Johnson, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_029">Symons, C.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using the Contributions of Hermann Ebbinghaus to Improve Your Memory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s02_p01">Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850–1909) was a pioneer of the study of memory. In this section we consider three of his most important findings, each of which can help you improve your memory. In his research, in which he was the only research participant, Ebbinghaus practiced memorizing lists of nonsense syllables, such as the following:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s02_p02">DIF, LAJ, LEQ, MUV, WYC, DAL, SEN, KEP, NUD</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s02_p03">You can imagine that because the material that he was trying to learn was not at all meaningful, it was not easy to do. Ebbinghaus plotted how many of the syllables he could remember against the time that had elapsed since he had studied them. He discovered an important principle of memory: Memory decays rapidly at first, but the amount of decay levels off with time (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s02_s02_f01">Figure 8.10 "Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve"</a>). Although Ebbinghaus looked at forgetting after days had elapsed, the same effect occurs on longer and shorter time scales. Bahrick (1984)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_030">Bahrick, H. P. (1984). Semantic memory content in permastore: Fifty years of memory for Spanish learned in school. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 113</em>(1), 1–29.</span> found that students who took a Spanish language course forgot about one half of the vocabulary that they had learned within three years, but that after that time their memory remained pretty much constant. Forgetting also drops off quickly on a shorter time frame. This suggests that you should try to review the material that you have already studied right before you take an exam; that way, you will be more likely to remember the material during the exam.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s02_p04">Ebbinghaus also discovered another important principle of learning, known as the <em class="emphasis">spacing effect</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spacing effect</a><span class="glossdef">The fact that learning is better when the same amount of study is spread out over periods of time than it is when it occurs closer together or at the same time.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the fact that learning is better when the same amount of study is spread out over periods of time than it is when it occurs closer together or at the same time</em>. This means that even if you have only a limited amount of time to study, you’ll learn more if you study continually throughout the semester (a little bit every day is best) than if you wait to cram at the last minute before your exam (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s02_s02_f02">Figure 8.11 "Effects of Massed Versus Distributed Practice on Learning"</a>). Another good strategy is to study and then wait as long as you can before you forget the material. Then review the information and again wait as long as you can before you forget it. (This probably will be a longer period of time than the first time.) Repeat and repeat again. The spacing effect is usually considered in terms of the difference between <em class="emphasis">distributed practice</em> (practice that is spread out over time) and <em class="emphasis">massed practice</em> (practice that comes in one block), with the former approach producing better memory.</p>

            <p class="para">The spacing effect refers to the fact that memory is better when it is <em class="emphasis">distributed</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">massed</em>. Leslie, Lee Ann, and Nora all studied for four hours total, but the students who spread out their learning into smaller study sessions did better on the exam.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s02_p05">Ebbinghaus also considered the role of <em class="emphasis">overlearning</em>—that is, continuing to practice and study even when we think that we have mastered the material. Ebbinghaus and other researchers have found that overlearning helps encoding (Driskell, Willis, &amp; Copper, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_031">Driskell, J. E., Willis, R. P., &amp; Copper, C. (1992). Effect of overlearning on retention. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 77</em>(5), 615–622.</span> Students frequently think that they have already mastered the material but then discover when they get to the exam that they have not. The point is clear: Try to keep studying and reviewing, even if you think you already know all the material.</p>

You can get an idea of the difficulty posed by retrieval by simply reading each of the words (but not the categories) in the sidebar below to someone. Tell the person that after you have read all the words, you will ask her to recall the words.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s03_p02">After you read the list to your friend, give her enough time to write down all the words that she can recall. Make sure that she cannot recall any more and then, for the words that were not listed, prompt your friend with some of the category names: “Do you remember any words that were furniture? Do you remember any words that were tools?” I think you will find that the category names, which serve as retrieval cues, will help your friend remember information that she could not retrieve otherwise.</p>

People who learn information when they are in a bad (rather than a good) mood find it easier to recall these memories when they are tested while they are in a bad mood, and vice versa. It is easier to recall unpleasant memories than pleasant ones when we’re sad, and easier to recall pleasant memories than unpleasant ones when we’re happy (Bower, 1981; Eich, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_035">Bower, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s03_p10">There are a number of explanations for primacy and recency effects, but one of them is in terms of the effects of rehearsal on short-term and long-term memory (Baddeley, Eysenck, &amp; Anderson, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_036">Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M. W., &amp; Anderson, M. C. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Memory</em>. New York, NY: Psychology Press.</span> Because we can keep the last words that we learned in the presented list in short-term memory by rehearsing them before the memory test begins, they are relatively easily remembered. So the recency effect can be explained in terms of maintenance rehearsal in short-term memory. And the primacy effect may also be due to rehearsal—when we hear the first word in the list we start to rehearse it, making it more likely that it will be moved from short-term to long-term memory. And the same is true for the other words that come early in the list. But for the words in the middle of the list, this rehearsal becomes much harder, making them less likely to be moved to LTM.</p>

Forming categories, and using categories to guide behavior, is a fundamental part of human nature. Associated concepts within a category are connected through <em class="emphasis">spreading activation</em>, which occurs when activating one element of a category activates other associated elements. For instance, because tools are associated in a category, reminding people of the word “screwdriver” will help them remember the word “wrench.” And, when people have learned lists of words that come from different categories (e.g., as in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s02_s03_n01">Note 8.33 "Retrieval Demonstration"</a>), they do not recall the information haphazardly. If they have just remembered the word “wrench,” they are more likely to remember the word “screwdriver” next than they are to remember the word “dahlia,” because the words are organized in memory by category and because “dahlia” is activated by spreading activation from “wrench” (Srull &amp; Wyer, 1989).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_037">Srull, T., &amp; Wyer, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s04_p02">Some categories have <em class="emphasis">defining features</em> that must be true of all members of the category. For instance, all members of the category “triangles” have three sides, and all members of the category “birds” lay eggs. But most categories are not so well-defined; the members of the category share some common features, but it is impossible to define which are or are not members of the category. For instance, there is no clear definition of the category “tool.” Some examples of the category, such as a hammer and a wrench, are clearly and easily identified as category members, whereas other members are not so obvious. Is an ironing board a tool? What about a car?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s04_p03">Members of categories (even those with defining features) can be compared to the category <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prototype</a><span class="glossdef">The member of the category that is most average or typical of the category.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">the member of the category that is most average or typical of the category</em>. Some category members are more prototypical of, or similar to, the category than others. For instance, some category members (robins and sparrows) are highly prototypical of the category “birds,” whereas other category members (penguins and ostriches) are less prototypical. We retrieve information that is prototypical of a category faster than we retrieve information that is less prototypical (Rosch, 1975).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_038">Rosch, E.

We have schemas about objects (that a triangle has three sides and may take on different angles), about people (that Sam is friendly, likes to golf, and always wears sandals), about events (the particular steps involved in ordering a meal at a restaurant), and about social groups (we call these group schemas <em class="emphasis">stereotypes</em>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s04_p05">Schemas are important in part because they help us remember new information by providing an organizational structure for it.

Of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities, that is the next step; otherwise you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. In the short run this may not seem important, but complications can easily arise. A mistake can be expensive as well. At first the whole procedure will seem complicated. Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to foresee any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but then one never can tell. After the procedure is completed, one arranges the materials into different groups again. Then they can be put into their appropriate places. Eventually they will be used once more and the whole cycle will then have to be repeated. However, that is part of life.</p>

One well-known case study was a man named Henry Gustav Molaison (before he died in 2008, he was referred to only as H.

Although he could remember most of what had happened before the operation, and particularly what had occurred early in his life, he could no longer create new memories. Molaison was said to have read the same magazines over and over again without any awareness of having seen them before.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s05_p06">Cases of anterograde amnesia also provide information about the brain structures involved in different types of memory (Bayley &amp; Squire, 2005; Helmuth, 1999; Paller, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_048">Bayley, P.

He could learn to trace shapes in a mirror, a task that requires procedural memory, but he never had any explicit recollection of having performed this task or of the people who administered the test to him.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s05_p07">Although some brain structures are particularly important in memory, this does not mean that all memories are stored in one place.

Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span> attempted to determine where memories were stored in the brain by teaching rats how to run mazes, and then lesioning different brain structures to see if they were still able to complete the maze. This idea seemed straightforward, and Lashley expected to find that memory was stored in certain parts of the brain. But he discovered that no matter where he removed brain tissue, the rats retained at least some memory of the maze, leading him to conclude that memory isn’t located in a single place in the brain, but rather is distributed around it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s05_p09">Our knowledge of the role of biology in memory suggests that it might be possible to use drugs to improve our memories, and Americans spend several hundred million dollars per year on memory supplements with the hope of doing just that. Yet controlled studies comparing memory enhancers, including Ritalin, methylphenidate, ginkgo biloba, and amphetamines, with placebo drugs find very little evidence for their effectiveness (Gold, Cahill, &amp; Wenk, 2002; McDaniel, Maier, &amp; Einstein, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_054">Gold, P.

This is not to say that we cannot someday create drugs that will significantly improve our memory. It is likely that this will occur in the future, but the implications of these advances are as yet unknown (Farah et al., 2004; Turner &amp; Sahakian, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_055">Farah, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s02_s05_p10">Although the most obvious potential use of drugs is to attempt to improve memory, drugs might also be used to help us forget. This might be desirable in some cases, such as for those suffering from <em class="emphasis">posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</em> who are unable to forget disturbing memories. Although there are no existing therapies that involve using drugs to help people forget, it is possible that they will be available in the future. These possibilities will raise some important ethical issues: Is it ethical to erase memories, and if it is, is it desirable to do so? Perhaps the experience of emotional pain is a part of being a human being. And perhaps the experience of emotional pain may help us cope with the trauma.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_p01">As we have seen, our memories are not perfect. They fail in part due to our inadequate encoding and storage, and in part due to our inability to accurately retrieve stored information. But memory is also influenced by the setting in which it occurs, by the events that occur to us after we have experienced an event, and by the cognitive processes that we use to help us remember. Although our cognition allows us to attend to, rehearse, and organize information, cognition may also lead to distortions and errors in our judgments and our behaviors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_p02">In this section we consider some of the <em class="emphasis">cognitive biases</em> that are known to influence humans. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive biases</a><span class="glossdef">Errors in memory or judgment that are caused by the inappropriate use of cognitive processes.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">errors in memory or judgment that are caused by the inappropriate use of cognitive processes</em> (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s03_t01">Table 8.3 "Cognitive Processes That Pose Threats to Accuracy"</a>).

Perhaps you’ve had the experience of wondering whether you really experienced an event or only dreamed or imagined it. If so, you wouldn’t be alone.

Studies suggest that people who are fantasy-prone are more likely to experience source monitoring errors (Winograd, Peluso, &amp; Glover, 1998),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_057">Winograd, E., Peluso, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s01_p02">In other cases we may be sure that we remembered the information from real life but be uncertain about exactly where we heard it. Imagine that you read a news story in a tabloid magazine such as the <em class="emphasis">National Enquirer</em>. Probably you would have discounted the information because you know that its source is unreliable. But what if later you were to remember the story but forget the source of the information? If this happens, you might become convinced that the news story is true because you forget to discount it.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Schematic Processing: Distortions Based on Expectations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s02_p01">We have seen that schemas help us remember information by organizing material into coherent representations. However, although schemas can improve our memories, they may also lead to cognitive biases. Using schemas may lead us to falsely remember things that never happened to us and to distort or misremember things that did. For one, schemas lead to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">confirmation bias</a><span class="glossdef">A cognitive bias that results in the tendency to verify and confirm our existing memories rather than to challenge and disconfirm them.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">the tendency to verify and confirm our existing memories rather than to challenge and disconfirm them</em>. The confirmation bias occurs because once we have schemas, they influence how we seek out and interpret new information. The confirmation bias leads us to remember information that fits our schemas better than we remember information that disconfirms them (Stangor &amp; McMillan, 1992),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_060">Stangor, C., &amp; McMillan, D. (1992). Memory for expectancy-congruent and expectancy-incongruent information: A review of the social and social developmental literatures. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 111</em>(1), 42–61.</span> a process that makes our stereotypes very difficult to change. And we ask questions in ways that confirm our schemas (Trope &amp; Thompson, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_061">Trope, Y., &amp; Thompson, E. (1997). Looking for truth in all the wrong places? Asymmetric search of individuating information about stereotyped group members. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73</em>, 229–241.</span> If we think that a person is an extrovert, we might ask her about ways that she likes to have fun, thereby making it more likely that we will confirm our beliefs. In short, once we begin to believe in something—for instance, a stereotype about a group of people—it becomes very difficult to later convince us that these beliefs are not true; the beliefs become self-confirming.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s02_p02">Darley and Gross (1983)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_062">Darley, J. M., &amp; Gross, P. H. (1983). A hypothesis-confirming bias in labeling effects. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44</em>, 20–33.</span> demonstrated how schemas about social class could influence memory. In their research they gave participants a picture and some information about a fourth-grade girl named Hannah. To activate a schema about her social class, Hannah was pictured sitting in front of a nice suburban house for one-half of the participants and pictured in front of an impoverished house in an urban area for the other half. Then the participants watched a video that showed Hannah taking an intelligence test. As the test went on, Hannah got some of the questions right and some of them wrong, but the number of correct and incorrect answers was the same in both conditions. Then the participants were asked to remember how many questions Hannah got right and wrong. Demonstrating that stereotypes had influenced memory, the participants who thought that Hannah had come from an upper-class background remembered that she had gotten more correct answers than those who thought she was from a lower-class background.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s02_p03">Our reliance on schemas can also make it more difficult for us to “think outside the box.” Peter Wason (1960)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_063">Wason, P. (1960). On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task. <em class="emphasis">The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 12</em>(3), 129–140.</span> asked college students to determine the rule that was used to generate the numbers 2-4-6 by asking them to generate possible sequences and then telling them if those numbers followed the rule. The first guess that students made was usually “consecutive ascending even numbers,” and they then asked questions designed to confirm their hypothesis (“Does 102-104-106 fit?” “What about 404-406-408?”). Upon receiving information that those guesses did fit the rule, the students stated that the rule was “consecutive ascending even numbers.” But the students’ use of the confirmation bias led them to ask only about instances that confirmed their hypothesis, and not about those that would disconfirm it. They never bothered to ask whether 1-2-3 or 3-11-200 would fit, and if they had they would have learned that the rule was not “consecutive ascending even numbers,” but simply “any three ascending numbers.” Again, you can see that once we have a schema (in this case a hypothesis), we continually retrieve that schema from memory rather than other relevant ones, leading us to act in ways that tend to confirm our beliefs.</p>

Few of the participants realized that the box could be tacked to the wall and used as a platform to hold the candle. The problem again is that our existing memories are powerful, and they bias the way we think about new information. Because the participants were “fixated” on the box’s normal function of holding thumbtacks, they could not see its alternative use.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s03_p04">In addition to distorting our memories for events that have actually occurred, misinformation may lead us to falsely remember information that never occurred. Loftus and her colleagues asked parents to provide them with descriptions of events that did (e.g., moving to a new house) and did not (e.g., being lost in a shopping mall) happen to their children. Then (without telling the children which events were real or made-up) the researchers asked the children to imagine both types of events. The children were instructed to “think real hard” about whether the events had occurred (Ceci, Huffman, Smith, &amp; Loftus, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_067">Ceci, S.

Repeatedly thinking about a non-event: Source misattributions among preschoolers. <em class="emphasis">Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal, 3</em>(3–4), 388–407.</span> More than half of the children generated stories regarding at least one of the made-up events, and they remained insistent that the events did in fact occur even when told by the researcher that they could not possibly have occurred (Loftus &amp; Pickrell, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_068">Loftus, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s03_p05">The ease with which memories can be created or implanted is particularly problematic when the events to be recalled have important consequences. Therapists often argue that patients may repress memories of traumatic events they experienced as children, such as childhood sexual abuse, and then recover the events years later as the therapist leads them to recall the information—for instance, by using dream interpretation and hypnosis (Brown, Scheflin, &amp; Hammond, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_070">Brown, D., Scheflin, A. W., &amp; Hammond, D. C. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Memory, trauma treatment, and the law</em>. New York, NY: Norton.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s03_p06">But other researchers argue that painful memories such as sexual abuse are usually very well remembered, that few memories are actually repressed, and that even if they are it is virtually impossible for patients to accurately retrieve them years later (McNally, Bryant, &amp; Ehlers, 2003; Pope, Poliakoff, Parker, Boynes, &amp; Hudson, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_071">McNally, R.

Because hundreds of people have been accused, and even imprisoned, on the basis of claims about “recovered memory” of child sexual abuse, the accuracy of these memories has important societal implications. Many psychologists now believe that most of these claims of recovered memories are due to implanted, rather than real, memories (Loftus &amp; Ketcham, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_072">Loftus, E.

The overconfidence effect in social prediction. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58</em>(4), 568–581.</span> asked college students to predict how another student would react in various situations. Some participants made predictions about a fellow student whom they had just met and interviewed, and others made predictions about their roommates whom they knew very well. In both cases, participants reported their confidence in each prediction, and accuracy was determined by the responses of the people themselves. The results were clear: Regardless of whether they judged a stranger or a roommate, the participants consistently overestimated the accuracy of their own predictions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s04_p02">Eyewitnesses to crimes are also frequently overconfident in their memories, and there is only a small correlation between how accurate and how confident an eyewitness is. The witness who claims to be absolutely certain about his or her identification (e.g., Jennifer Thompson) is not much more likely to be accurate than one who appears much less sure, making it almost impossible to determine whether a particular witness is accurate or not (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_074">Wells, G.

These recordings were made on September 12, 2001. Then the participants were asked again, either 1, 6, or 32 weeks later, to recall their memories. The participants became less accurate in their recollections of both the emotional event and the everyday events over time. But the participants’ confidence in the accuracy of their memory of learning about the attacks did not decline over time. After 32 weeks the participants were overconfident; they were much more certain about the accuracy of their flashbulb memories than they should have been.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s05_p03">Most people think that list B is more likely, probably because list B looks more random, and thus matches (is “representative of”) our ideas about randomness. But statisticians know that any pattern of four girls and four boys is mathematically equally likely. The problem is that we have a schema of what randomness should be like, which doesn’t always match what is mathematically the case. Similarly, people who see a flipped coin come up “heads” five times in a row will frequently predict, and perhaps even wager money, that “tails” will be next. This behavior is known as the <em class="emphasis">gambler’s fallacy</em>. But mathematically, the gambler’s fallacy is an error: The likelihood of any single coin flip being “tails” is always 50%, regardless of how many times it has come up “heads” in the past.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s05_p04">Our judgments can also be influenced by how easy it is to retrieve a memory. <em class="emphasis">The tendency to make judgments of the frequency or likelihood that an event occurs on the basis of the ease with which it can be retrieved from memory</em> is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">availability heuristic</a><span class="glossdef">A cognitive bias that involves the tendency to make judgments of the frequency or likelihood that an event occurs on the basis of the ease with which the event can be retrieved from memory.</span></span> (MacLeod &amp; Campbell, 1992; Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1973).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_078">MacLeod, C., &amp; Campbell, L. (1992). Memory accessibility and probability judgments: An experimental evaluation of the availability heuristic. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63</em>(6), 890–902; Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. (1973). Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability. <em class="emphasis">Cognitive Psychology, 5</em>, 207–232.</span> Imagine, for instance, that I asked you to indicate whether there are more words in the English language that begin with the letter “R” or that have the letter “R” as the third letter. You would probably answer this question by trying to think of words that have each of the characteristics, thinking of all the words you know that begin with “R” and all that have “R” in the third position. Because it is much easier to retrieve words by their first letter than by their third, we may incorrectly guess that there are more words that begin with “R,” even though there are in fact more words that have “R” as the third letter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s05_p05">The availability heuristic may also operate on episodic memory. We may think that our friends are nice people, because we see and remember them primarily when they are around us (their friends, who they are, of course, nice to). And the traffic might seem worse in our own neighborhood than we think it is in other places, in part because nearby traffic jams are more easily retrieved than are traffic jams that occur somewhere else.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p01">Still another potential for bias in memory occurs because we are more likely to attend to, and thus make use of and remember, some information more than other information. For one, we tend to attend to and remember things that are highly <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">salient</a><span class="glossdef">Attracting attention.</span></span>, meaning that <em class="emphasis">they attract our attention</em>. Things that are unique, colorful, bright, moving, and unexpected are more salient (McArthur &amp; Post, 1977; Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_079">McArthur, L. Z., &amp; Post, D. L. (1977). Figural emphasis and person perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 13</em>(6), 520–535; Taylor, S. E., &amp; Fiske, S. T. (1978).

Some facts about “weapon focus.” <em class="emphasis">Law and Human Behavior, 11</em>(1), 55–62.</span> showed people images of a customer walking up to a bank teller and pulling out either a pistol or a checkbook. By tracking eye movements, the researchers determined that people were more likely to look at the gun than at the checkbook, and that this reduced their ability to accurately identify the criminal in a lineup that was given later. The salience of the gun drew people’s attention away from the face of the criminal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p02">The salience of the stimuli in our social worlds has a big influence on our judgment, and in some cases may lead us to behave in ways that we might better not have. Imagine, for instance, that you wanted to buy a new music player for yourself. You’ve been trying to decide whether to get the iPod or the Zune. You checked <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em> online and found that, although the players differed on many dimensions, including price, battery life, ability to share music, and so forth, the Zune was nevertheless rated significantly higher by owners than was the iPod. As a result, you decide to purchase the Zune the next day. That night, however, you go to a party, and a friend shows you her iPod. You check it out, and it seems really cool. You tell her that you were thinking of buying a Zune, and she tells you that you are crazy. She says she knows someone who had one and it had a lot of problems—it didn’t download music correctly, the battery died right after the warranty expired, and so forth—and that she would never buy one. Would you still buy the Zune, or would you switch your plans?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p03">If you think about this question logically, the information that you just got from your friend isn’t really all that important. You now know the opinion of one more person, but that can’t change the overall rating of the two machines very much. On the other hand, the information your friend gives you, and the chance to use her iPod, are highly salient. The information is right there in front of you, in your hand, whereas the statistical information from <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em> is only in the form of a table that you saw on your computer. The outcome in cases such as this is that people frequently ignore the less salient but more important information, such as the likelihood that events occur across a large population (these statistics are known as <em class="emphasis">base rates</em>), in favor of the less important but nevertheless more salient information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p04">People also vary in the schemas that they find important to use when judging others and when thinking about themselves. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive accessibility</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which knowledge is activated in memory, and thus likely to be used in cognition and behavior.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the extent to which knowledge is activated in memory, and thus likely to be used in cognition and behavior</em>. For instance, you probably know a person who is a golf nut (or fanatic of another sport). All he can talk about is golf. For him, we would say that golf is a highly accessible construct. Because he loves golf, it is important to his self-concept, he sets many of his goals in terms of the sport, and he tends to think about things and people in terms of it (“if he plays golf, he must be a good person!”). Other people have highly accessible schemas about environmental issues, eating healthy food, or drinking really good coffee. When schemas are highly accessible, we are likely to use them to make judgments of ourselves and others, and this overuse may inappropriately color our judgments.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p01">In addition to influencing our judgments about ourselves and others, the ease with which we can retrieve potential experiences from memory can have an important effect on our own emotions. If we can easily imagine an outcome that is better than what actually happened, then we may experience sadness and disappointment; on the other hand, if we can easily imagine that a result might have been worse than what actually happened, we may be more likely to experience happiness and satisfaction. <em class="emphasis">The tendency to think about and experience events according to “what might have been”</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">counterfactual thinking</a><span class="glossdef">A cognitive bias that involves the tendency to think about and experience events according to “what might have been.”</span></span> (Kahneman &amp; Miller, 1986; Roese, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_081">Kahneman, D., &amp; Miller, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p02">Imagine, for instance, that you were participating in an important contest, and you won the silver (second-place) medal. How would you feel? Certainly you would be happy that you won the silver medal, but wouldn’t you also be thinking about what might have happened if you had been just a little bit better—you might have won the gold medal! On the other hand, how might you feel if you won the bronze (third-place) medal? If you were thinking about the <em class="emphasis">counterfactuals</em> (the “what might have beens”) perhaps the idea of not getting any medal at all would have been highly accessible; you’d be happy that you got the medal that you did get, rather than coming in fourth.</p>

H., Madey, S. F., &amp; Gilovich, T. (1995). When less is more: Counterfactual thinking and satisfaction among Olympic medalists. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 69</em>(4), 603–610.</span> investigated this idea by videotaping the responses of athletes who won medals in the 1992 Summer Olympic Games. They videotaped the athletes both as they learned that they had won a silver or a bronze medal and again as they were awarded the medal. Then the researchers showed these videos, without any sound, to raters who did not know which medal which athlete had won. The raters were asked to indicate how they thought the athlete was feeling, using a range of feelings from “agony” to “ecstasy.” The results showed that the bronze medalists were, on average, rated as happier than were the silver medalists. In a follow-up study, raters watched interviews with many of these same athletes as they talked about their performance. The raters indicated what we would expect on the basis of counterfactual thinking—the silver medalists talked about their disappointments in having finished second rather than first, whereas the bronze medalists focused on how happy they were to have finished third rather than fourth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p04">You might have experienced counterfactual thinking in other situations. Once I was driving across country, and my car was having some engine trouble. I really wanted to make it home when I got near the end of my journey; I would have been extremely disappointed if the car broke down only a few miles from my home. Perhaps you have noticed that once you get close to finishing something, you feel like you really need to get it done. Counterfactual thinking has even been observed in juries. Jurors who were asked to award monetary damages to others who had been in an accident offered them substantially more in compensation if they barely avoided injury than they offered if the accident seemed inevitable (Miller, Turnbull, &amp; McFarland, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_084">Miller, D.

            <h3 class="title">Psychology in Everyday Life: Cognitive Biases in the Real World</h3>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p05">Perhaps you are thinking that the kinds of errors that we have been talking about don’t seem that important. After all, who really cares if we think there are more words that begin with the letter “R” than there actually are, or if bronze medal winners are happier than the silver medalists? These aren’t big problems in the overall scheme of things. But it turns out that what seem to be relatively small cognitive biases on the surface can have profound consequences for people.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p06">Why would so many people continue to purchase lottery tickets, buy risky investments in the stock market, or gamble their money in casinos when the likelihood of them ever winning is so low? One possibility is that they are victims of salience; they focus their attention on the salient likelihood of a big win, forgetting that the base rate of the event occurring is very low. The belief in astrology, which all scientific evidence suggests is not accurate, is probably driven in part by the salience of the occasions when the predictions are correct. When a horoscope comes true (which will, of course, happen sometimes), the correct prediction is highly salient and may allow people to maintain the overall false belief.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p07">People may also take more care to prepare for unlikely events than for more likely ones, because the unlikely ones are more salient. For instance, people may think that they are more likely to die from a terrorist attack or a homicide than they are from diabetes, stroke, or tuberculosis. But the odds are much greater of dying from the latter than the former. And people are frequently more afraid of flying than driving, although the likelihood of dying in a car crash is hundreds of times greater than dying in a plane crash (more than 50,000 people are killed on U.S. highways every year). Because people don’t accurately calibrate their behaviors to match the true potential risks (e.g., they drink and drive or don’t wear their seatbelts), the individual and societal level costs are often quite large (Slovic, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_085">Slovic, P. (Ed.). (2000). <em class="emphasis">The perception of risk</em>. London, England: Earthscan Publications.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p08">Salience and accessibility also color how we perceive our social worlds, which may have a big influence on our behavior. For instance, people who watch a lot of violent television shows also view the world as more dangerous (Doob &amp; Macdonald, 1979),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_086">Doob, A. N., &amp; Macdonald, G. E. (1979). Television viewing and fear of victimization: Is the relationship causal? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(2), 170–179.</span> probably because violence becomes more cognitively accessible for them. We also unfairly overestimate our contribution to joint projects (Ross &amp; Sicoly, 1979),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_087">Ross, M., &amp; Sicoly, F. (1979). Egocentric biases in availability and attribution. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(3), 322–336.</span> perhaps in part because our own contributions are highly accessible, whereas the contributions of others are much less so.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p09">Even people who should know better, and who <em class="emphasis">need</em> to know better, are subject to cognitive biases. Economists, stock traders, managers, lawyers, and even doctors make the same kinds of mistakes in their professional activities that people make in their everyday lives (Gilovich, Griffin, &amp; Kahneman, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_088">Gilovich, T., Griffin, D., &amp; Kahneman, D. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Heuristics and biases: The psychology of intuitive judgment</em>. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</span> Just like us, these people are victims of overconfidence, heuristics, and other biases.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p10">Furthermore, every year thousands of individuals, such as Ronald Cotton, are charged with and often convicted of crimes based largely on eyewitness evidence. When eyewitnesses testify in courtrooms regarding their memories of a crime, they often are completely sure that they are identifying the right person. But the most common cause of innocent people being falsely convicted is erroneous eyewitness testimony (Wells, Wright, &amp; Bradfield, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_089">Wells, G. L., Wright, E. F., &amp; Bradfield, A. L. (1999). Witnesses to crime: Social and cognitive factors governing the validity of people’s reports. In R. Roesch, S. D. Hart, &amp; J. R. P.

Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers.</span> The many people who were convicted by mistaken eyewitnesses prior to the advent of forensic DNA and who have now been exonerated by DNA tests have certainly paid for all-too-common memory errors (Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_090">Wells, G.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p11">Although cognitive biases are common, they are not impossible to control, and psychologists and other scientists are working to help people make better decisions. One possibility is to provide people with better feedback about their judgments. Weather forecasters, for instance, learn to be quite accurate in their judgments because they have clear feedback about the accuracy of their predictions. Other research has found that accessibility biases can be reduced by leading people to consider multiple alternatives rather than focus only on the most obvious ones, and particularly by leading people to think about opposite possible outcomes than the ones they are expecting (Lilienfeld, Ammirtai, &amp; Landfield, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_091">Lilienfeld, S.

<span class="title-prefix">8.4</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p01">Memory and cognition are the two major interests of cognitive psychologists. The cognitive school was influenced in large part by the development of the electronic computer. Psychologists conceptualize memory in terms of types, stages, and processes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p02">Explicit memory is assessed using measures in which the individual being tested must consciously attempt to remember the information. Explicit memory includes semantic and episodic memory. Explicit memory tests include recall memory tests, recognition memory tests, and measures of relearning (also known as savings).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p03">Implicit memory refers to the influence of experience on behavior, even if the individual is not aware of those influences. Implicit memory is made up of procedural memory, classical conditioning effects, and priming. Priming refers both to the activation of knowledge and to the influence of that activation on behavior. An important characteristic of implicit memories is that they are frequently formed and used automatically, without much effort or awareness on our part.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p04">Sensory memory, including iconic and echoic memory, is a memory buffer that lasts only very briefly and then, unless it is attended to and passed on for more processing, is forgotten.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p05">Information that we turn our attention to may move into short-term memory (STM). STM is limited in both the length and the amount of information it can hold. Working memory is a set of memory procedures or operations that operates on the information in STM. Working memory’s central executive directs the strategies used to keep information in STM, such as maintenance rehearsal, visualization, and chunking.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p06">Long-term memory (LTM) is memory storage that can hold information for days, months, and years. The information that we want to remember in LTM must be encoded and stored, and then retrieved. Some strategies for improving LTM include elaborative encoding, relating information to the self, making use of the forgetting curve and the spacing effect, overlearning, and being aware of context- and state-dependent retrieval effects.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p07">Memories that are stored in LTM are not isolated but rather are linked together into categories and schemas. Schemas are important in part because they help us encode and retrieve information by providing an organizational structure for it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p08">The ability to maintain information in LTM involves a gradual strengthening of the connections among the neurons in the brain, known as long-term potentiation (LTP). The hippocampus is important in explicit memory, the cerebellum is important in implicit memory, and the amygdala is important in emotional memory. A number of neurotransmitters are important in consolidation and memory. Evidence for the role of different brain structures in different types of memories comes in part from case studies of patients who suffer from amnesia.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s04_p09">Cognitive biases are errors in memory or judgment that are caused by the inappropriate use of cognitive processes. These biases are caused by the overuse of schemas, the reliance on salient and cognitive accessible information, and the use of rule-of-thumb strategies known as heuristics. These biases include errors in source monitoring, the confirmation bias, functional fixedness, the misinformation effect, overconfidence, and counterfactual thinking. Understanding the potential cognitive errors we frequently make can help us make better decisions and engage in more appropriate behaviors.</p>
