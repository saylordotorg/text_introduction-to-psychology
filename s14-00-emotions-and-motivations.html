        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p01">He was 3,000 feet up in the air when the sudden loss of power in his airplane put his life, as well as the lives of 150 other passengers and crew members, in his hands. Both of the engines on flight 1539 had shut down, and his options for a safe landing were limited.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p02">Sully kept flying the plane and alerted the control tower to the situation:</p>

        </span>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p04">When the tower gave him the compass setting and runway for a possible landing, Sullenberger’s extensive experience allowed him to give a calm response:</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch10_bl02">
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p05">I’m not sure if we can make any runway…Anything in New Jersey?</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p06">Captain Sullenberger was not just any pilot in a crisis, but a former U.S. Air Force fighter pilot with 40 years of flight experience. He had served as a flight instructor and the Airline Pilots Association safety chairman. Training had quickened his mental processes in assessing the threat, allowing him to maintain what tower operators later called an “eerie calm.” He knew the capabilities of his plane.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch10_p07">When the tower suggested a runway in New Jersey, Sullenberger calmly replied:</p>

The crew kept the passengers calm as women, children, and then the rest of the passengers were evacuated onto the boats of the rescue personnel that had quickly arrived. Captain Sullenberger then calmly walked the aisle of the plane to be sure that everyone was out before joining the 150 other rescued survivors (Levin, 2009; National Transportation Safety Board, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_001">Levin, A.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p13">The topic of this chapter is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">affect</a><span class="glossdef">The experience of feeling or emotion.</span></span>, defined as <em class="emphasis">the experience of feeling or emotion</em>. Affect is an essential part of the study of psychology because it plays such an important role in everyday life. As we will see, affect guides behavior, helps us make decisions, and has a major impact on our mental and physical health.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p14">The two fundamental components of affect are <em class="emphasis">emotions</em> and <em class="emphasis">motivation</em>. Both of these words have the same underlying Latin root, meaning “to move.” In contrast to cognitive processes that are calm, collected, and frequently rational, emotions and motivations involve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">arousal</a><span class="glossdef">Our experiences of the bodily responses created by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.</span></span>, or <em class="emphasis">our experiences of the bodily responses created by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)</em>. Because they involve arousal, emotions and motivations are “hot”—they “charge,” “drive,” or “move” our behavior.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p15">When we experience emotions or strong motivations, we <em class="emphasis">feel</em> the experiences. When we become aroused, the sympathetic nervous system provides us with energy to respond to our environment. The liver puts extra sugar into the bloodstream, the heart pumps more blood, our pupils dilate to help us see better, respiration increases, and we begin to perspire to cool the body. The stress hormones <em class="emphasis">epinephrine</em> and <em class="emphasis">norepinephrine</em> are released. We experience these responses as arousal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p16">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotion</a><span class="glossdef">A mental and physiological feeling state that directs our attention and guides our behavior.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a mental and physiological feeling state that directs our attention and guides our behavior</em>. Whether it is the thrill of a roller-coaster ride that elicits an unexpected scream, the flush of embarrassment that follows a public mistake, or the horror of a potential plane crash that creates an exceptionally brilliant response in a pilot, emotions move our actions. Emotions normally serve an adaptive role: We care for infants because of the love we feel for them, we avoid making a left turn onto a crowded highway because we fear that a speeding truck may hit us, and we are particularly nice to Mandy because we are feeling guilty that we didn’t go to her party. But emotions may also be destructive, such as when a frustrating experience leads us to lash out at others who do not deserve it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p17">Motivations are closely related to emotions. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">motivation</a><span class="glossdef">A driving force that initiates and directs behavior.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a driving force that initiates and directs behavior</em>. Some motivations are biological, such as the motivation for food, water, and sex. But there are a variety of other personal and social motivations that can influence behavior, including the motivations for social approval and acceptance, the motivation to achieve, and the motivation to take, or to avoid taking, risks (Morsella, Bargh, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_002">Morsella, E., Bargh, J. A., &amp; Gollwitzer, P. M. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Oxford handbook of human action</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> In each case we follow our motivations because they are rewarding. As predicted by basic theories of operant learning, motivations lead us to engage in particular behaviors because doing so makes us feel good.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p18">Motivations are often considered in psychology in terms of <em class="emphasis">drives</em>, which are internal states that are activated when the physiological characteristics of the body are out of balance, and <em class="emphasis">goals</em>, which are desired end states that we strive to attain. Motivation can thus be conceptualized as a series of behavioral responses that lead us to attempt to reduce drives and to attain goals by comparing our current state with a desired end state (Lawrence, Carver, &amp; Scheier, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_003">Lawrence, J. W., Carver, C. S., &amp; Scheier, M. F. (2002). Velocity toward goal attainment in immediate experience as a determinant of affect. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32</em>(4), 788–802.</span> Like a thermostat on an air conditioner, the body tries to maintain <em class="emphasis">homeostasis</em>, the natural state of the body’s systems, with goals, drives, and arousal in balance. When a drive or goal is aroused—for instance, when we are hungry—the thermostat turns on and we start to behave in a way that attempts to reduce the drive or meet the goal (in this case to seek food). As the body works toward the desired end state, the thermostat continues to check whether or not the end state has been reached. Eventually, the need or goal is satisfied (we eat), and the relevant behaviors are turned off. The body’s thermostat continues to check for homeostasis and is always ready to react to future needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p19">In addition to more basic motivations such as hunger, a variety of other personal and social motivations can also be conceptualized in terms of drives or goals. When the goal of studying for an exam is hindered because we take a day off from our schoolwork, we may work harder on our studying on the next day to move us toward our goal. When we are dieting, we may be more likely to have a big binge on a day when the scale says that we have met our prior day’s goals. And when we are lonely, the motivation to be around other people is aroused and we try to socialize. In many, if not most cases, our emotions and motivations operate out of our conscious awareness to guide our behavior (Freud, 1922; Hassin, Bargh, &amp; Zimerman, 2009; Williams, Bargh, Nocera, &amp; Gray, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_004">Freud, S. (1922). The unconscious. <em class="emphasis">The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 56</em>(3), 291; Hassin, R. R., Bargh, J. A., &amp; Zimerman, S. (2009). Automatic and flexible: The case of nonconscious goal pursuit. <em class="emphasis">Social Cognition, 27</em>(1), 20–36; Williams, L. E., Bargh, J. A., Nocera, C. C., &amp; Gray, J. R. (2009). The unconscious regulation of emotion: Nonconscious reappraisal goals modulate emotional reactivity. <em class="emphasis">Emotion, 9</em>(6), 847–854.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_p20">We begin this chapter by considering the role of affect on behavior, discussing the most important psychological theories of emotions. Then we will consider how emotions influence our mental and physical health. We will discuss how the experience of long-term <em class="emphasis">stress</em> causes illness, and then turn to research on <em class="emphasis">positive thinking</em> and what has been learned about the beneficial health effects of more positive emotions. Finally, we will review some of the most important human motivations, including the behaviors of eating and sex. The importance of this chapter is not only in helping you gain an understanding the principles of affect but also in helping you discover the important roles that affect plays in our everyday lives, and particularly in our mental and physical health. The study of the interface between affect and physical health—that principle that “everything that is physiological is also psychological”—is a key focus of the branch of psychology known as <em class="emphasis">health psychology</em>. The importance of this topic has made health psychology one of the fastest growing fields in psychology.</p>
