Psychoactive drugs are also frequently prescribed as sleeping pills, tranquilizers, and antianxiety medications, and they may be taken, illegally, for recreational purposes. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch05_s02_t01">Table 5.1 "Psychoactive Drugs by Class"</a>, the four primary classes of psychoactive drugs are <em class="emphasis">stimulants</em>, <em class="emphasis">depressants</em>, <em class="emphasis">opioids</em>, and <em class="emphasis">hallucinogens</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p02">Psychoactive drugs affect consciousness by influencing how neurotransmitters operate at the synapses of the central nervous system (CNS). Some psychoactive drugs are agonists, which mimic the operation of a neurotransmitter; some are antagonists, which block the action of a neurotransmitter; and some work by blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters at the synapse.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p03">In some cases the effects of psychoactive drugs mimic other naturally occurring states of consciousness. For instance, sleeping pills are prescribed to create drowsiness, and benzodiazepines are prescribed to create a state of relaxation. In other cases psychoactive drugs are taken for recreational purposes with the goal of creating states of consciousness that are pleasurable or that help us escape our normal consciousness.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p04">The use of psychoactive drugs, and especially those that are used illegally, has the potential to create very negative side effects (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch05_s02_t01">Table 5.1 "Psychoactive Drugs by Class"</a>). This does not mean that all drugs are dangerous, but rather that all drugs can be dangerous, particularly if they are used regularly over long periods of time. Psychoactive drugs create negative effects not so much through their initial use but through the continued use, accompanied by increasing doses, that ultimately may lead to drug abuse.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p05">The problem is that many drugs create <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tolerance</a><span class="glossdef">An increase in the dose of a drug required to produce the same effect.</span></span>: <em class="emphasis">an increase in the dose required to produce the same effect</em>, which makes it necessary for the user to increase the dosage or the number of times per day that the drug is taken. As the use of the drug increases, the user may develop a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dependence</a><span class="glossdef">The need to use a drug or other substance regularly.</span></span>, defined as a <em class="emphasis">need to use a drug or other substance regularly</em>. Dependence can be psychological, in which the drug is desired and has become part of the everyday life of the user, but no serious physical effects result if the drug is not obtained; or physical, in which serious physical and mental effects appear when the drug is withdrawn. Cigarette smokers who try to quit, for example, experience physical withdrawal symptoms, such as becoming tired and irritable, as well as extreme psychological cravings to enjoy a cigarette in particular situations, such as after a meal or when they are with friends.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p06">Users may wish to stop using the drug, but when they reduce their dosage they experience <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">withdrawal</a><span class="glossdef">Negative experiences that accompany reducing or stopping drug use, including physical pain and other symptoms.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">negative experiences that accompany reducing or stopping drug use, including physical pain and other symptoms</em>. <em class="emphasis">When the user powerfully craves the drug and is driven to seek it out, over and over again, no matter what the physical, social, financial, and legal cost,</em> we say that he or she has developed an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">addiction</a><span class="glossdef">When the user powerfully craves the drug and is driven to seek it out, over and over again, no matter what the physical, social, financial, and legal cost.</span></span> to the drug.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p07">It is a common belief that addiction is an overwhelming, irresistibly powerful force, and that withdrawal from drugs is always an unbearably painful experience. But the reality is more complicated and in many cases less extreme. For one, even drugs that we do not generally think of as being addictive, such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, can be very difficult to quit using, at least for some people. On the other hand, drugs that are normally associated with addiction, including amphetamines, cocaine, and heroin, do not immediately create addiction in their users. Even for a highly addictive drug like cocaine, only about 15% of users become addicted (Robinson &amp; Berridge, 2003; Wagner &amp; Anthony, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_036">Robinson, T. E., &amp; Berridge, K. C. (2003). Addiction. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Psychology, 54</em>, 25–53; Wagner, F. A., &amp; Anthony, J. C. (2002). From first drug use to drug dependence: Developmental periods of risk for dependence upon marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol. <em class="emphasis">Neuropsychopharmacology, 26</em>(4), 479–488.</span> Furthermore, the rate of addiction is lower for those who are taking drugs for medical reasons than for those who are using drugs recreationally. Patients who have become physically dependent on morphine administered during the course of medical treatment for a painful injury or disease are able to be rapidly weaned off the drug afterward, without becoming addicts. Robins, Davis, and Goodwin (1974)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_037">Robins, L. N., Davis, D. H., &amp; Goodwin, D. W. (1974). Drug use by U.S. Army enlisted men in Vietnam: A follow-up on their return home. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Epidemiology, 99</em>, 235–249.</span> found that the majority of soldiers who had become addicted to morphine while overseas were quickly able to stop using after returning home.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p08">This does not mean that using recreational drugs is not dangerous. For people who do become addicted to drugs, the success rate of recovery is low. These drugs are generally illegal and carry with them potential criminal consequences if one is caught and arrested. Drugs that are smoked may produce throat and lung cancers and other problems. Snorting (“sniffing”) drugs can lead to a loss of the sense of smell, nosebleeds, difficulty in swallowing, hoarseness, and chronic runny nose. Injecting drugs intravenously carries with it the risk of contracting infections such as hepatitis and HIV. Furthermore, the quality and contents of illegal drugs are generally unknown, and the doses can vary substantially from purchase to purchase. The drugs may also contain toxic chemicals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p09">Another problem is the unintended consequences of combining drugs, which can produce serious side effects. Combining drugs is dangerous because their combined effects on the CNS can increase dramatically and can lead to accidental or even deliberate overdoses. For instance, ingesting alcohol or benzodiazepines along with the usual dose of heroin is a frequent cause of overdose deaths in opiate addicts, and combining alcohol and cocaine can have a dangerous impact on the cardiovascular system (McCance-Katz, Kosten, &amp; Jatlow, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_038">McCance-Katz, E., Kosten, T., &amp; Jatlow, P. (1998). Concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol is more potent and potentially more toxic than use of either alone—A multiple-dose study 1. <em class="emphasis">Biological Psychiatry, 44</em>(4), 250–259.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_p10">Although all recreational drugs are dangerous, some can be more deadly than others. One way to determine how dangerous recreational drugs are is to calculate a <em class="emphasis">safety ratio</em>, based on the dose that is likely to be fatal divided by the normal dose needed to feel the effects of the drug. Drugs with lower ratios are more dangerous because the difference between the normal and the lethal dose is small. For instance, heroin has a safety ratio of 6 because the average fatal dose is only 6 times greater than the average effective dose. On the other hand, marijuana has a safety ratio of 1,000. This is not to say that smoking marijuana cannot be deadly, but it is much less likely to be deadly than is heroin. The safety ratios of common recreational drugs are shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch05_s02_t02">Table 5.2 "Popular Recreational Drugs and Their Safety Ratios"</a>.</p>

Because more of these neurotransmitters remain active in the brain, the result is an increase in the activity of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Effects of stimulants include increased heart and breathing rates, pupil dilation, and increases in blood sugar accompanied by decreases in appetite. For these reasons, stimulants are frequently used to help people stay awake and to control weight.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Used in moderation, some stimulants may increase alertness, but used in an irresponsible fashion they can quickly create dependency. A major problem is the “crash” that results when the drug loses its effectiveness and the activity of the neurotransmitters returns to normal. The withdrawal from stimulants can create profound depression and lead to an intense desire to repeat the high.</p>

It is found in a wide variety of products, including coffee, tea, soft drinks, candy, and desserts. In North America, more than 80% of adults consume caffeine daily (Lovett, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_039">Lovett, R. (2005, September 24).

Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists caffeine as a safe food substance, it has at least some characteristics of dependence. People who reduce their caffeine intake often report being irritable, restless, and drowsy, as well as experiencing strong headaches, and these withdrawal symptoms may last up to a week. Most experts feel that using small amounts of caffeine during pregnancy is safe, but larger amounts of caffeine can be harmful to the fetus (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_040">U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Nicotine is the main cause for the dependence-forming properties of tobacco use, and tobacco use is a major health threat. Nicotine creates both psychological and physical addiction, and it is one of the hardest addictions to break. Nicotine content in cigarettes has slowly increased over the years, making quitting smoking more and more difficult. Nicotine is also found in smokeless (chewing) tobacco.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s01_p05">People who want to quit smoking sometimes use other drugs to help them. For instance, the prescription drug Chantix acts as an antagonist, binding to nicotine receptors in the synapse, which prevents users from receiving the normal stimulant effect when they smoke. At the same time, the drug also releases dopamine, the reward neurotransmitter. In this way Chantix dampens nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cravings. In many cases people are able to get past the physical dependence, allowing them to quit smoking at least temporarily. In the long run, however, the psychological enjoyment of smoking may lead to relapse.</p>

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a primary constituent in many popular tonics and elixirs and, although it was removed in 1905, was one of the original ingredients in Coca-Cola. Today cocaine is taken illegally as recreational drug.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s01_p07">Cocaine has a variety of adverse effects on the body. It constricts blood vessels, dilates pupils, and increases body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. It can cause headaches, abdominal pain, and nausea. Since cocaine also tends to decrease appetite, chronic users may also become malnourished. The intensity and duration of cocaine’s effects, which include increased energy and reduced fatigue, depend on how the drug is taken. The faster the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream and delivered to the brain, the more intense the high. Injecting or smoking cocaine produces a faster, stronger high than snorting it. However, the faster the drug is absorbed, the faster the effects subside. The high from snorting cocaine may last 30 minutes, whereas the high from smoking “crack” cocaine may last only 10 minutes. In order to sustain the high, the user must administer the drug again, which may lead to frequent use, often in higher doses, over a short period of time (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_041">National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Amphetamine is used in prescription medications to treat attention deficit disorder (ADD) and narcolepsy, and to control appetite. Some brand names of amphetamines are Adderall, Benzedrine, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse. But amphetamine (“speed”) is also used illegally as a recreational drug. The methylated version of amphetamine, <em class="emphasis">methamphetamine</em> (“meth” or “crank”), is currently favored by users, partly because it is available in ampoules ready for use by injection (Csaky &amp; Barnes, 1984).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_042">Csaky, T. Z., &amp; Barnes, B. A. (1984). <em class="emphasis">Cutting’s handbook of pharmacology</em> (7th ed.).

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s01_p09">Amphetamines may produce a very high level of tolerance, leading users to increase their intake, often in “jolts” taken every half hour or so. Although the level of physical dependency is small, amphetamines may produce very strong psychological dependence, effectively amounting to addiction. Continued use of stimulants may result in severe psychological depression. The effects of the stimulant methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as “Ecstasy,” provide a good example. MDMA is a very strong stimulant that very successfully prevents the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. It is so effective that when used repeatedly it can seriously deplete the amount of neurotransmitters available in the brain, producing a catastrophic mental and physical “crash” resulting in serious, long-lasting depression. MDMA also affects the temperature-regulating mechanisms of the brain, so in high doses, and especially when combined with vigorous physical activity like dancing, it can cause the body to become so drastically overheated that users can literally “burn up” and die from hyperthermia and dehydration.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s02_p01">In contrast to stimulants, which work to increase neural activity, a <em class="emphasis">depressant</em> acts to slow down consciousness.

Depressants are widely used as prescription medicines to relieve pain, to lower heart rate and respiration, and as anticonvulsants. Depressants change consciousness by increasing the production of the neurotransmitter GABA and decreasing the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, usually at the level of the thalamus and the reticular formation. The outcome of depressant use (similar to the effects of sleep) is a reduction in the transmission of impulses from the lower brain to the cortex (Csaky &amp; Barnes, 1984).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_043">Csaky, T.

In low to moderate doses, alcohol first acts to remove social inhibitions by slowing activity in the sympathetic nervous system. In higher doses, alcohol acts on the cerebellum to interfere with coordination and balance, producing the staggering gait of drunkenness. At high blood levels, further CNS depression leads to dizziness, nausea, and eventually a loss of consciousness. High enough blood levels such as those produced by “guzzling” large amounts of hard liquor at parties can be fatal. Alcohol is not a “safe” drug by any means—its safety ratio is only 10.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s02_p03">Alcohol use is highly costly to societies because so many people abuse alcohol and because judgment after drinking can be substantially impaired. It is estimated that almost half of automobile fatalities are caused by alcohol use, and excessive alcohol consumption is involved in a majority of violent crimes, including rape and murder (Abbey, Ross, McDuffie, &amp; McAuslan, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_044">Abbey, A., Ross, L.

The psychology of drunken excess. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48</em>(1), 18–34.</span> When people are intoxicated, they become more self-focused and less aware of the social situation. As a result, they become less likely to notice the social constraints that normally prevent them from engaging aggressively, and are less likely to use those social constraints to guide them. For instance, we might normally notice the presence of a police officer or other people around us, which would remind us that being aggressive is not appropriate. But when we are drunk, we are less likely to be so aware. The narrowing of attention that occurs when we are intoxicated also prevents us from being cognizant of the negative outcomes of our aggression. When we are sober, we realize that being aggressive may produce retaliation, as well as cause a host of other problems, but we are less likely to realize these potential consequences when we have been drinking (Bushman &amp; Cooper, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_047">Bushman, B.

When morphine was first refined from opium in the early 19th century, it was touted as a cure for opium addiction, but it didn’t take long to discover that it was actually more addicting than raw opium. When heroin was produced a few decades later, it was also initially thought to be a more potent, less addictive painkiller but was soon found to be much more addictive than morphine. Heroin is about twice as addictive as morphine, and creates severe tolerance, moderate physical dependence, and severe psychological dependence. The danger of heroin is demonstrated in the fact that it has the lowest safety ratio (6) of all the drugs listed in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch05_s02_t01">Table 5.1 "Psychoactive Drugs by Class"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s03_p03">The opioids activate the sympathetic division of the ANS, causing blood pressure and heart rate to increase, often to dangerous levels that can lead to heart attack or stroke. At the same time the drugs also influence the parasympathetic division, leading to constipation and other negative side effects. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal include diarrhea, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, and vomiting, all accompanied by a strong craving for the drug. The powerful psychological dependence of the opioids and the severe effects of withdrawal make it very difficult for morphine and heroin abusers to quit using. In addition, because many users take these drugs intravenously and share contaminated needles, they run a very high risk of being infected with diseases. Opioid addicts suffer a high rate of infections such as HIV, pericarditis (an infection of the membrane around the heart), and hepatitis B, any of which can be fatal.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s04_p01">The drugs that produce the most extreme alteration of consciousness are the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hallucinogens</a><span class="glossdef">A family of psychoactive drugs that alter sensation and perception.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">psychoactive drugs that alter sensation and perception and that may create hallucinations</em>. The hallucinogens are frequently known as “psychedelics.” Drugs in this class include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD, or “Acid”), mescaline, and phencyclidine (PCP), as well as a number of natural plants including cannabis (marijuana), peyote, and psilocybin. The chemical compositions of the hallucinogens are similar to the neurotransmitters serotonin and epinephrine, and they act primarily as agonists by mimicking the action of serotonin at the synapses. The hallucinogens may produce striking changes in perception through one or more of the senses. The precise effects a user experiences are a function not only of the drug itself, but also of the user’s preexisting mental state and expectations of the drug experience. In large part, the user tends to get out of the experience what he or she brings to it.The hallucinations that may be experienced when taking these drugs are strikingly different from everyday experience and frequently are more similar to dreams than to everyday consciousness.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s04_p02">Cannabis (marijuana) is the most widely used hallucinogen. Until it was banned in the United States under the Marijuana Tax Act of 1938, it was widely used for medical purposes. In recent years, cannabis has again been frequently prescribed for the treatment of pain and nausea, particularly in cancer sufferers, as well as for a wide variety of other physical and psychological disorders (Ben Amar, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_049">Ben Amar, M. (2006). Cannabinoids in medicine: A review of their therapeutic potential. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 105</em>, 1–25.</span> While medical marijuana is now legal in several American states, it is still banned under federal law, putting those states in conflict with the federal government. Marijuana also acts as a stimulant, producing giggling, laughing, and mild intoxication. It acts to enhance perception of sights, sounds, and smells, and may produce a sensation of time slowing down. It is much less likely to lead to antisocial acts than that other popular intoxicant, alcohol, and it is also the one psychedelic drug whose use has not declined in recent years (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_050">National Institute on Drug Abuse.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s04_p03">Although the hallucinogens are powerful drugs that produce striking “mind-altering” effects, they do not produce physiological or psychological tolerance or dependence. While they are not addictive and pose little physical threat to the body, their use is not advisable in any situation in which the user needs to be alert and attentive, exercise focused awareness or good judgment, or demonstrate normal mental functioning, such as driving a car, studying, or operating machinery.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why We Use Psychoactive Drugs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p01">People have used, and often abused, psychoactive drugs for thousands of years. Perhaps this should not be suprising, because many people find using drugs to be fun and enjoyable. Even when we know the potential costs of using drugs, we may engage in them anyway because the pleasures of using the drugs are occurring right now, whereas the potential costs are abstract and occur in the future.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Research Focus: Risk Tolerance Predicts Cigarette Use</h3>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p02">Because drug and alcohol abuse is a behavior that has such important negative consequences for so many people, researchers have tried to understand what leads people to use drugs. Carl Lejuez and his colleagues (Lejuez, Aklin, Bornovalova, &amp; Moolchan, 2005)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_051">Lejuez, C. W., Aklin, W. M., Bornovalova, M. A., &amp; Moolchan, E. T. (2005). Differences in risk-taking propensity across inner-city adolescent ever- and never-smokers. <em class="emphasis">Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research, 7</em>(1), 71–79.</span> tested the hypothesis that cigarette smoking was related to a desire to take risks. In their research they compared risk-taking behavior in adolescents who reported having tried a cigarette at least once with those who reported that they had never tried smoking.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p03">Participants in the research were 125 5th- through 12th-graders attending after-school programs throughout inner-city neighborhoods in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. Eighty percent of the adolescents indicated that they had never tried even a puff of a cigarette, and 20% indicated that they had had at least one puff of a cigarette.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p04">The participants were tested in a laboratory where they completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a measure of risk taking (Lejuez et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_052">Lejuez, C. W., Read, J. P., Kahler, C. W., Richards, J. B., Ramsey, S. E., Stuart, G. L.,…Brown, R. A. (2002). Evaluation of a behavioral measure of risk taking: The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 8</em>(2), 75–85.</span> The BART is a computer task in which the participant pumps up a series of simulated balloons by pressing on a computer key. With each pump the balloon appears bigger on the screen, and more money accumulates in a temporary “bank account.” However, when a balloon is pumped up too far, the computer generates a popping sound, the balloon disappears from the screen, and all the money in the temporary bank is lost. At any point during each balloon trial, the participant can stop pumping up the balloon, click on a button, transfer all money from the temporary bank to the permanent bank, and begin with a new balloon.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p05">Because the participants do not have precise information about the probability of each balloon exploding, and because each balloon is programmed to explode after a different number of pumps, the participants have to determine how much to pump up the balloon. The number of pumps that participants take is used as a measure of their tolerance for risk. Low-tolerance people tend to make a few pumps and then collect the money, whereas more risky people pump more times into each balloon.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p06">Supporting the hypothesis that risk tolerance is related to smoking, Lejuez et al. found that the tendency to take risks was indeed correlated with cigarette use: The participants who indicated that they had puffed on a cigarette had significantly higher risk-taking scores on the BART than did those who had never tried smoking.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p07">Individual ambitions, expectations, and values also influence drug use.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_p08">Drug use is in part the result of socialization. Children try drugs when their friends convince them to do it, and these decisions are based on social norms about the risks and benefits of various drugs. In the period 1991 to 1997, the percentage of 12th-graders who responded that they perceived “great harm in regular marijuana use” declined from 79% to 58%, while annual use of marijuana in this group rose from 24% to 39% (Johnston et al., 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn05_055">Johnston, L.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch05_s02_s05_l01">
                <li>Psychoactive drugs are chemicals that change our state of consciousness. They work by influencing neurotransmitters in the CNS.</li>
                <li>Using psychoactive drugs may create tolerance and, when they are no longer used, withdrawal. Addiction may result from tolerance and the difficulty of withdrawal.</li>
                <li>Stimulants, including caffeine, nicotine, and amphetamine, increase neural activity by blocking the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the CNS.</li>
                <li>Depressants, including, alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, decrease consciousness by increasing the production of the neurotransmitter GABA and decreasing the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.</li>
                <li>Opioids, including codeine, opium, morphine and heroin, produce euphoria and analgesia by increasing activity in opioid receptor neurons.</li>
                <li>Hallucinogens, including cannabis, mescaline, and LSD, create an extreme alteration of consciousness as well as the possibility of hallucinations.</li>
                <li>Recreational drug use is influenced by social norms as well as by individual differences. People who are more likely to take risks are also more likely to use drugs.</li>
