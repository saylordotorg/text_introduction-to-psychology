        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s01_p02">Explicit memory is assessed using measures in which the individual being tested must consciously attempt to remember the information.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s01_p03">Your own experiences taking tests will probably lead you to agree with the scientific research finding that recall is more difficult than recognition. Recall, such as required on essay tests, involves two steps: first generating an answer and then determining whether it seems to be the correct one. Recognition, as on multiple-choice test, only involves determining which item from a list seems most correct (Haist, Shimamura, &amp; Squire, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_012">Haist, F., Shimamura, A. P., &amp; Squire, L. R. (1992). On the relationship between recall and recognition memory. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18</em>(4), 691–702.</span> Although they involve different processes, recall and recognition memory measures tend to be correlated. Students who do better on a multiple-choice exam will also, by and large, do better on an essay exam (Bridgeman &amp; Morgan, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_013">Bridgeman, B., &amp; Morgan, R. (1996). Success in college for students with discrepancies between performance on multiple-choice and essay tests. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Educational Psychology, 88</em>(2), 333–340.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s01_p04">A third way of measuring memory is known as <em class="emphasis">relearning</em> (Nelson, 1985).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_014">Nelson, T. O. (1985). Ebbinghaus’s contribution to the measurement of retention: Savings during relearning. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 11</em>(3), 472–478.</span> Measures of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relearning (or savings)</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of explicit memory that involves assessing how much more quickly information is processed or learned when it is studied again after it has already been learned but then forgotten.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">assess how much more quickly information is processed or learned when it is studied again after it has already been learned but then forgotten</em>. If you have taken some French courses in the past, for instance, you might have forgotten most of the vocabulary you learned. But if you were to work on your French again, you’d learn the vocabulary much faster the second time around. Relearning can be a more sensitive measure of memory than either recall or recognition because it allows assessing memory in terms of “how much” or “how fast” rather than simply “correct” versus “incorrect” responses. Relearning also allows us to measure memory for procedures like driving a car or playing a piano piece, as well as memory for facts and figures.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Implicit Memory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p01">While explicit memory consists of the things that we can consciously report that we know, implicit memory refers to knowledge that we cannot consciously access. However, implicit memory is nevertheless exceedingly important to us because it has a direct effect on our behavior. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Implicit memory</a><span class="glossdef">The influence of experience on behavior, even if the individual is not aware of those influences.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the influence of experience on behavior, even if the individual is not aware of those influences</em>. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s01_s01_f01">Figure 8.2 "Types of Memory"</a>, there are three general types of implicit memory: procedural memory, classical conditioning effects, and priming.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Procedural memory</a><span class="glossdef">Implicit memory about our often unexplainable knowledge of how to do things.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">our often unexplainable knowledge of how to do things</em>. When we walk from one place to another, speak to another person in English, dial a cell phone, or play a video game, we are using procedural memory. Procedural memory allows us to perform complex tasks, even though we may not be able to explain to others how we do them. There is no way to tell someone how to ride a bicycle; a person has to learn by doing it. The idea of implicit memory helps explain how infants are able to learn. The ability to crawl, walk, and talk are procedures, and these skills are easily and efficiently developed while we are children despite the fact that as adults we have no conscious memory of having learned them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p03">A second type of implicit memory is classical conditioning effects, in which we learn, often without effort or awareness, to associate neutral stimuli (such as a sound or a light) with another stimulus (such as food), which creates a naturally occurring response, such as enjoyment or salivation. The memory for the association is demonstrated when the conditioned stimulus (the sound) begins to create the same response as the unconditioned stimulus (the food) did before the learning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p04">The final type of implicit memory is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priming</a><span class="glossdef">Changes in behavior as a result of experiences that have happened frequently or recently.</span></span>, or <em class="emphasis">changes in behavior as a result of experiences that have happened frequently or recently</em>. Priming refers both to the activation of knowledge (e.g., we can prime the concept of “kindness” by presenting people with words related to kindness) and to the influence of that activation on behavior (people who are primed with the concept of kindness may act more kindly).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p05">One measure of the influence of priming on implicit memory is the <em class="emphasis">word fragment test</em>, in which a person is asked to fill in missing letters to make words. You can try this yourself: First, try to complete the following word fragments, but work on each one for only three or four seconds. Do any words pop into mind quickly?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p06">_ i b _ a _ y</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p09">_ h _ i s _</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p10">Now read the following sentence carefully:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p11">“He got his materials from the shelves, checked them out, and then left the building.”</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p12">Then try again to make words out of the word fragments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p13">I think you might find that it is easier to complete fragments 1 and 3 as “library” and “book,” respectively, after you read the sentence than it was before you read it. However, reading the sentence didn’t really help you to complete fragments 2 and 4 as “physician” and “chaise.” This difference in implicit memory probably occurred because as you read the sentence, the concept of “library” (and perhaps “book”) was primed, even though they were never mentioned explicitly. Once a concept is primed it influences our behaviors, for instance, on word fragment tests.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p14">Our everyday behaviors are influenced by priming in a wide variety of situations. Seeing an advertisement for cigarettes may make us start smoking, seeing the flag of our home country may arouse our patriotism, and seeing a student from a rival school may arouse our competitive spirit. And these influences on our behaviors may occur without our being aware of them.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p15">One of the most important characteristics of implicit memories is that they are frequently formed and used <em class="emphasis">automatically</em>, without much effort or awareness on our part. In one demonstration of the automaticity and influence of priming effects, John Bargh and his colleagues (Bargh, Chen, &amp; Burrows, 1996)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_015">Bargh, J. A., Chen, M., &amp; Burrows, L. (1996). Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 71</em>, 230–244.</span> conducted a study in which they showed college students lists of five scrambled words, each of which they were to make into a sentence. Furthermore, for half of the research participants, the words were related to stereotypes of the elderly. These participants saw words such as the following:</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_bl02">
                <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p16">in Florida retired live people</p>

            </span>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p18">The other half of the research participants also made sentences, but from words that had nothing to do with elderly stereotypes. The purpose of this task was to prime stereotypes of elderly people in memory for some of the participants but not for others.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s02_p19">The experimenters then assessed whether the priming of elderly stereotypes would have any effect on the students’ behavior—and indeed it did. When the research participant had gathered all of his or her belongings, thinking that the experiment was over, the experimenter thanked him or her for participating and gave directions to the closest elevator. Then, without the participants knowing it, the experimenters recorded the amount of time that the participant spent walking from the doorway of the experimental room toward the elevator. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s01_s02_f01">Figure 8.3 "Results From Bargh, Chen, and Burrows, 1996"</a>, participants who had made sentences using words related to elderly stereotypes took on the behaviors of the elderly—they walked significantly more slowly as they left the experimental room.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_p01">Another way of understanding memory is to think about it in terms of stages that describe the length of time that information remains available to us.

This finding confirmed Sperling’s hunch: Participants had access to all of the letters in their iconic memories, and if the task was short enough, they were able to report on the part of the display he asked them to. The “short enough” is the length of iconic memory, which turns out to be about 250 milliseconds (¼ of a second).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p05">In some people iconic memory seems to last longer, a phenomenon known as <em class="emphasis">eidetic imagery</em> (or “photographic memory”) in which people can report details of an image over long periods of time. These people, who often suffer from psychological disorders such as autism, claim that they can “see” an image long after it has been presented, and can often report accurately on that image. There is also some evidence for eidetic memories in hearing; some people report that their echoic memories persist for unusually long periods of time. The composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart may have possessed eidetic memory for music, because even when he was very young and had not yet had a great deal of musical training, he could listen to long compositions and then play them back almost perfectly (Solomon, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_018">Solomon, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p03">To successfully accomplish the task, you have to answer each of the math problems correctly and at the same time remember the letter that follows the task. Then, after the six questions, you must list the letters that appeared in each of the trials in the correct order (in this case S, R, P, T, U, Q).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p04">To accomplish this difficult task you need to use a variety of skills. You clearly need to use STM, as you must keep the letters in storage until you are asked to list them. But you also need a way to make the best use of your available attention and processing. For instance, you might decide to use a strategy of “repeat the letters twice, then quickly solve the next problem, and then repeat the letters twice again including the new one.” Keeping this strategy (or others like it) going is the role of working memory’s <em class="emphasis">central executive</em>—the part of working memory that directs attention and processing. The central executive will make use of whatever strategies seem to be best for the given task. For instance, the central executive will direct the rehearsal process, and at the same time direct the visual cortex to form an image of the list of letters in memory. You can see that although STM is involved, the processes that we use to operate on the material in memory are also critical.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p06">One way to prevent the decay of information from short-term memory is to use working memory to rehearse it. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Maintenance rehearsal</a><span class="glossdef">The process of repeating information mentally or out loud with the goal of keeping it in short-term memory.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the process of repeating information mentally or out loud with the goal of keeping it in memory</em>. We engage in maintenance rehearsal to keep a something that we want to remember (e.g., a person’s name, e-mail address, or phone number) in mind long enough to write it down, use it, or potentially transfer it to long-term memory.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p07">If we continue to rehearse information it will stay in STM until we stop rehearsing it, but there is also a capacity limit to STM.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p17">The digit span of most adults is between five and nine digits, with an average of about seven. The cognitive psychologist George Miller (1956)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_022">Miller, G. A. (1956). The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 63</em>(2), 81–97.</span> referred to “seven plus or minus two” pieces of information as the “magic number” in short-term memory. But if we can only hold a maximum of about nine digits in short-term memory, then how can we remember larger amounts of information than this?

I think it would, because then rather than remembering 12 letters, you would only have to remember the names of four television stations. In this case, chunking changes the number of items you have to remember from 12 to only four.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p24">Experts rely on chunking to help them process complex information.

Skill in chess. <em class="emphasis">American Scientist, 61</em>(4), 394–403.</span> showed chess masters and chess novices various positions of pieces on a chessboard for a few seconds each. The experts did a lot better than the novices in remembering the positions because they were able to see the “big picture.” They didn’t have to remember the position of each of the pieces individually, but chunked the pieces into several larger layouts. But when the researchers showed both groups random chess positions—positions that would be very unlikely to occur in real games—both groups did equally poorly, because in this situation the experts lost their ability to organize the layouts (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s01_s03_s02_f02">Figure 8.7 "Possible and Impossible Chess Positions"</a>). The same occurs for basketball. Basketball players recall actual basketball positions much better than do nonplayers, but only when the positions make sense in terms of what is happening on the court, or what is likely to happen in the near future, and thus can be chunked into bigger units (Didierjean &amp; Marmèche, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_024">Didierjean, A., &amp; Marmèche, E.
