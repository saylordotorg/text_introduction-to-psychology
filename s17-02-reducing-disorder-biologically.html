        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_p01">Psychologists understand that an appropriate balance of neurotransmitters in the brain is necessary for mental health. If there is a proper balance of chemicals, then the person’s mental health will be acceptable, but psychological disorder will result if there is a chemical imbalance. The most frequently used biological treatments provide the patient with medication that influences the production and reuptake of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS). The use of these drugs is rapidly increasing, and drug therapy is now the most common approach to treatment of most psychological disorders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Unlike some medical therapies that can be targeted toward specific symptoms, current psychological drug therapies are not so specific; they don’t change particular behaviors or thought processes, and they don’t really solve psychological disorders. However, although they cannot “cure” disorder, drug therapies are nevertheless useful therapeutic approaches, particularly when combined with psychological therapy, in treating a variety of psychological disorders. The best drug combination for the individual patient is usually found through trial and error (Biedermann &amp; Fleischhacker, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_026">Biedermann, F., &amp; Fleischhacker, W.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Using Stimulants to Treat ADHD</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p01">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently treated with biomedical therapy, usually along with cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). The most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD are psychostimulants, including Ritalin, Adderall, and Dexedrine. Short-acting forms of the drugs are taken as pills and last between 4 and 12 hours, but some of the drugs are also available in long-acting forms (skin patches) that can be worn on the hip and last up to 12 hours. The patch is placed on the child early in the morning and worn all day.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p02">Stimulants improve the major symptoms of ADHD, including inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, often dramatically, in about 75% of the children who take them (Greenhill, Halperin, &amp; Abikof, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_027">Greenhill, L. L., Halperin, J. M., &amp; Abikof, H. (1999). Stimulant medications. <em class="emphasis">Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 38</em>(5), 503–512.</span> But the effects of the drugs wear off quickly. Additionally, the best drug and best dosage varies from child to child, so it may take some time to find the correct combination.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p03">It may seem surprising to you that a disorder that involves hyperactivity is treated with a psychostimulant, a drug that normally increases activity. The answer lies in the dosage. When large doses of stimulants are taken, they increase activity, but in smaller doses the same stimulants improve attention and decrease motor activity (Zahn, Rapoport, &amp; Thompson, 1980).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_028">Zahn, T. P., Rapoport, J. L., &amp; Thompson, C. L. (1980).

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p04">The most common side effects of psychostimulants in children include decreased appetite, weight loss, sleeping problems, and irritability as the effect of the medication tapers off. Stimulant medications may also be associated with a slightly reduced growth rate in children, although in most cases growth isn’t permanently affected (Spencer, Biederman, Harding, &amp; O’Donnell, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_029">Spencer, T.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Antidepressant medications</a><span class="glossdef">Drugs designed to improve moods.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">drugs designed to improve moods</em>. Although they are used primarily in the treatment of depression, they are also effective for patients who suffer from anxiety, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Antidepressants work by influencing the production and reuptake of neurotransmitters that relate to emotion, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Although exactly why they work is not yet known, as the amount of the neurotransmitters in the CNS is increased through the action of the drugs, the person often experiences less depression.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p02">The original antidepressants were the <em class="emphasis">tricyclic antidepressants</em>, with the brand names of Tofranil and Elavil, and the <em class="emphasis">monamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)</em>. These medications work by increasing the amount of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine at the synapses, but they also have severe side effects including potential increases in blood pressure and the need to follow particular diets.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p03">The antidepressants most prescribed today are the <em class="emphasis">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</em> (<em class="emphasis">SSRIs</em>), including Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft, which are designed to selectively block the reuptake of serotonin at the synapse, thereby leaving more serotonin available in the CNS. SSRIs are safer and have fewer side effects than the tricyclics or the MAOIs (Fraser, 2000; Hollon, Thase, &amp; Markowitz, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_030">Fraser, A. R. (2000). Antidepressant choice to minimize treatment resistance. <em class="emphasis">The British Journal of Psychiatry, 176</em>, 493; Hollon, S. D., Thase, M. E., &amp; Markowitz, J. C. (2002). Treatment and prevention of depression. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 3</em>, 39–77.</span> SSRIs are effective, but patients taking them often suffer a variety of sometimes unpleasant side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, headache, agitation, drowsiness, as well as a reduction in sexual enjoyment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p04">Recently, there has been concern that SSRIs may increase the risk of suicide among teens and young adults, probably because when the medications begin working they give patients more energy, which may lead them to commit the suicide that they had been planning but lacked the energy to go through with. This concern has led the FDA to put a warning label on SSRI medications and has led doctors to be more selective about prescribing antidepressants to this age group (Healy &amp; Whitaker, 2003; Simon, 2006; Simon, Savarino, Operskalski, &amp; Wang, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_031">Healy, D., &amp; Whitaker, C.

Suicide risk during antidepressant treatment. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Psychiatry, 163</em>, 41–47. doi:10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.41</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p05">Because the effects of antidepressants may take weeks or even months to develop, doctors usually work with each patient to determine which medications are most effective, and may frequently change medications over the course of therapy. In some cases other types of antidepressants may be used instead of or in addition to the SSRIs. These medications also work by blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Brand names of these medications include Effexor and Wellbutrin.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p06">Patients who are suffering from bipolar disorder are not helped by the SSRIs or other antidepressants because their disorder also involves the experience of overly positive moods. Treatment is more complicated for these patients, often involving a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants along with <em class="emphasis">mood stabilizing medications</em> (McElroy &amp; Keck, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_032">McElroy, S. L., &amp; Keck, P. E. (2000). Pharmacologic agents for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. <em class="emphasis">Biological Psychiatry, 48</em>, 539–557.</span> The most well-known mood stabilizer, lithium carbonate (or “lithium”), was approved by the FDA in the 1970s for treating both manic and depressive episodes, and it has proven very effective. Anticonvulsant medications can also be used as mood stabilizers. Another drug, Depakote, has also proven very effective, and some bipolar patients may do better with it than with lithium (Kowatch et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_033">Kowatch, R. A., Suppes, T., Carmody, T. J., Bucci, J. P., Hume, J. H., Kromelis, M.,…Rush, A. J. (2000). Effect size of lithium, divalproex sodium, and carbamazepine in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. <em class="emphasis">Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 39</em>, 713–20.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p07">People who take lithium must have regular blood tests to be sure that the levels of the drug are in the appropriate range. Potential negative side effects of lithium are loss of coordination, slurred speech, frequent urination, and excessive thirst. Though side effects often cause patients to stop taking their medication, it is important that treatment be continuous, rather than intermittent. There is no cure for bipolar disorder, but drug therapy does help many people.</p>

These drugs, which are prescribed millions of times a year, include Ativan, Valium, and Xanax. The benzodiazepines act within a few minutes to treat mild anxiety disorders but also have major side effects. They are addictive, frequently leading to tolerance, and they can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms including relapses into increased anxiety (Otto et al., 1993).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_034">Otto, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p01">Until the middle of the 20th century, schizophrenia was inevitably accompanied by the presence of positive symptoms, including bizarre, disruptive, and potentially dangerous behavior. As a result, schizophrenics were locked in asylums to protect them from themselves and to protect society from them. In the 1950s, a drug called chlorpromazine (Thorazine) was discovered that could reduce many of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Chlorpromazine was the first of many <em class="emphasis">antipsychotic drugs</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics)</a><span class="glossdef">Drugs that treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and related disorders.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">drugs that treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders</em>. Today there are many antipsychotics, including Thorazine, Haldol, Clozaril, Risperdal, and Zyprexa. Some of these drugs treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and some treat both the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p03">The discovery of chlorpromazine and its use in clinics has been described as the single greatest advance in psychiatric care, because it has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients in psychiatric hospitals worldwide. Using antipsychotic medications has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to move out of asylums into individual households or community mental health centers, and in many cases to live near-normal lives.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p04">Antipsychotics reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia by reducing the transmission of dopamine at the synapses in the limbic system, and they improve negative symptoms by influencing levels of serotonin (Marangell, Silver, Goff, &amp; Yudofsky, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_035">Marangell, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p01">In cases of severe disorder it may be desirable to directly influence brain activity through electrical activation of the brain or through brain surgery. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</a><span class="glossdef">A medical procedure designed to alleviate psychological disorder in which electric currents are passed through the brain, deliberately triggering a brief seizure.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a medical procedure designed to alleviate psychological disorder in which electric currents are passed through the brain, deliberately triggering a brief seizure</em> (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch13_s02_s02_f01">Figure 13.7 "Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)"</a>). ECT has been used since the 1930s to treat severe depression.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p02">When it was first developed, the procedure involved strapping the patient to a table before the electricity was administered. The patient was knocked out by the shock, went into severe convulsions, and awoke later, usually without any memory of what had happened. Today ECT is used only in the most severe cases when all other treatments have failed, and the practice is more humane. The patient is first given muscle relaxants and a general anesthesia, and precisely calculated electrical currents are used to achieve the most benefit with the fewest possible risks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p03">ECT is very effective; about 80% of people who undergo three sessions of ECT report dramatic relief from their depression. ECT reduces suicidal thoughts and is assumed to have prevented many suicides (Kellner et al., 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_038">Kellner, C.

Relief of expressed suicidal intent by ECT: A consortium for research in ECT study. <em class="emphasis">The American Journal of Psychiatry, 162</em>(5), 977–982.</span> On the other hand, the positive effects of ECT do not always last; over one-half of patients who undergo ECT experience relapse within one year, although antidepressant medication can help reduce this outcome (Sackheim et al., 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_039">Sackheim, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p04">Although ECT continues to be used, newer approaches to treating chronic depression are also being developed. A newer and gentler method of brain stimulation is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</a><span class="glossdef">A medical procedure designed to reduce psychological disorder that uses a pulsing magnetic coil to electrically stimulate the brain.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a medical procedure designed to reduce psychological disorder that uses a pulsing magnetic coil to electrically stimulate the brain</em> (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch13_s02_s02_f02">Figure 13.8 "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)"</a>). TMS seems to work by activating neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex, which is less active in people with depression, causing an elevation of mood. TMS can be performed without sedation, does not cause seizures or memory loss, and may be as effective as ECT (Loo, Schweitzer, &amp; Pratt, 2006; Rado, Dowd, &amp; Janicak, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_041">Loo, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p05">Still other biomedical therapies are being developed for people with severe depression that persists over years. One approach involves implanting a device in the chest that stimulates the vagus nerve, a major nerve that descends from the brain stem toward the heart (Corcoran, Thomas, Phillips, &amp; O’Keane, 2006; Nemeroff et al., 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_042">Corcoran, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Psychosurgery</a><span class="glossdef">Surgery that removes or destroys brain tissue in the hope of improving disorder.</span></span>, that is, <em class="emphasis">surgery that removes or destroys brain tissue in the hope of improving disorder,</em> is reserved for the most severe cases. The most well-known psychosurgery is the <em class="emphasis">prefrontal lobotomy</em>. Developed in 1935 by Nobel Prize winner Egas Moniz to treat severe phobias and anxiety, the procedure destroys the connections between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain. Lobotomies were performed on thousands of patients. The procedure—which was never validated scientifically—left many patients in worse condition than before, subjecting the already suffering patients and their families to further heartbreak (Valenstein, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_043">Valenstein, E. (1986). <em class="emphasis">Great and desperate cures: The rise and decline of psychosurgery and other radical treatments for mental illness</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p07">There are very few centers that still conduct psychosurgery today, and when such surgeries are performed they are much more limited in nature and called <em class="emphasis">cingulotomy</em> (Dougherty et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_044">Dougherty, D., Baer, L., Cosgrove, G., Cassem, E., Price, B., Nierenberg, A.,…Rauch, S.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Psychostimulants are commonly prescribed to reduce the symptoms of ADHD.</li>
                <li>Antipsychotic drugs play a crucial role in the treatment of schizophrenia. They do not cure schizophrenia, but they help reduce the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms, making it easier to live with the disease.</li>
                <li>Antidepressant drugs are used in the treatment of depression, anxiety, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. They gradually elevate mood by working to balance neurotransmitters in the CNS. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants are the SSRIs.</li>
                <li>Antianxiety drugs (tranquilizers) relieve apprehension, tension, and nervousness and are prescribed for people with diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder. The drugs are effective but have severe side effects including dependence and withdrawal symptoms.</li>
                <li>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a controversial procedure used to treat severe depression, in which electric currents are passed through the brain, deliberately triggering a brief seizure.</li>
                <li>A newer method of brain stimulation is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive procedure that employs a pulsing magnetic coil to electrically stimulate the brain.</li>
