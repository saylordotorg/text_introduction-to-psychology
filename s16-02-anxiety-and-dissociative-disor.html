        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s01_p04">In addition to their feelings of anxiety, people who suffer from GAD may also experience a variety of physical symptoms, including irritability, sleep troubles, difficulty concentrating, muscle aches, trembling, perspiration, and hot flashes. The sufferer cannot deal with what is causing the anxiety, nor avoid it, because there is no clear cause for anxiety. In fact, the sufferer frequently knows, at least cognitively, that there is really nothing to worry about.</p>

I was driving home, my three little girls were in their car seats in the back, and all of a sudden I couldn’t breathe, I broke out into a sweat, and my heart began racing and literally beating against my ribs! I thought I was going to die. I pulled off the road and put my head on the wheel. I remember songs playing on the CD for about 15 minutes and my kids’ voices singing along. I was sure I’d never see them again. And then, it passed. I slowly got back on the road and drove home. I had no idea what it was.

Symptoms of a panic attack include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, trembling, dizziness, choking sensations, nausea, and an intense feeling of dread or impending doom. Panic attacks can often be mistaken for heart attacks or other serious physical illnesses, and they may lead the person experiencing them to go to a hospital emergency room. Panic attacks may last as little as one or as much as 20 minutes, but they often peak and subside within about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s02_p03">Sufferers are often anxious because they fear that they will have another attack. They focus their attention on the thoughts and images of their fears, becoming excessively sensitive to cues that signal the possibility of threat (MacLeod, Rutherford, Campbell, Ebsworthy, &amp; Holker, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_034">MacLeod, C., Rutherford, E., Campbell, L., Ebsworthy, G., &amp; Holker, L. (2002). Selective attention and emotional vulnerability: Assessing the causal basis of their association through the experimental manipulation of attentional bias. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 111</em>(1), 107–123.</span> They may also become unsure of the source of their arousal, misattributing it to situations that are not actually the cause. As a result, they may begin to avoid places where attacks have occurred in the past, such as driving, using an elevator, or being in public places. Panic disorder affects about 3% of the American population in a given year.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Phobias</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s03_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">phobia</a><span class="glossdef">A specific fear of a certain object, situation, or activity.</span></span> (from the Greek word <em class="emphasis">phobos</em>, which means “fear”) is <em class="emphasis">a specific fear of a certain object, situation, or activity</em>. The fear experience can range from a sense of unease to a full-blown panic attack. Most people learn to live with their phobias, but for others the fear can be so debilitating that they go to extremes to avoid the fearful situation. A sufferer of arachnophobia (fear of spiders), for example, may refuse to enter a room until it has been checked thoroughly for spiders, or may refuse to vacation in the countryside because spiders may be there. Phobias are characterized by their specificity and their irrationality. A person with acrophobia (a fear of height) could fearlessly sail around the world on a sailboat with no concerns yet refuse to go out onto the balcony on the fifth floor of a building.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s03_p02">A common phobia is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social phobia</a><span class="glossdef">Extreme shyness around people or discomfort in social situations.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">extreme shyness around people or discomfort in social situations</em>. Social phobia may be specific to a certain event, such as speaking in public or using a public restroom, or it can be a more generalized anxiety toward almost all people outside of close family and friends. People with social phobia will often experience physical symptoms in public, such as sweating profusely, blushing, stuttering, nausea, and dizziness. They are convinced that everybody around them notices these symptoms as they are occurring. Women are somewhat more likely than men to suffer from social phobia.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s03_p03">The most incapacitating phobia is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">agoraphobia</a><span class="glossdef">Anxiety about being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help may not be available.</span></span>, defined as <em class="emphasis">anxiety about being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing, or in which help may not be available</em> (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_035">American Psychiatric Association. (2000). <em class="emphasis">Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</em> (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.</span> Typical places that provoke the panic attacks are parking lots; crowded streets or shops; and bridges, tunnels, or expressways. People (mostly women) who suffer from agoraphobia may have great difficulty leaving their homes and interacting with other people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s03_p04">Phobias affect about 9% of American adults, and they are about twice as prevalent in women as in men (Fredrikson, Annas, Fischer, &amp; Wik, 1996; Kessler, Meron-Ruscio, Shear, &amp; Wittchen, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_036">Fredrikson, M., Annas, P., Fischer, H., &amp; Wik, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s04_p02">David Beckham’s experience with obsessive behavior is not unusual. We all get a little obsessive at times. We may continuously replay a favorite song in our heads, worry about getting the right outfit for an upcoming party, or find ourselves analyzing a series of numbers that seem to have a certain pattern. And our everyday compulsions can be useful. Going back inside the house once more to be sure that we really did turn off the sink faucet or checking the mirror a couple of times to be sure that our hair is combed are not necessarily bad ideas.</p>

OCD is diagnosed when the obsessive thoughts are so disturbing and the compulsive behaviors are so time consuming that they cause distress and significant dysfunction in a person’s everyday life. Washing your hands once or even twice to make sure that they are clean is normal; washing them 20 times is not. Keeping your fridge neat is a good idea; spending hours a day on it is not. The sufferers know that these rituals are senseless, but they cannot bring themselves to stop them, in part because the relief that they feel after they perform them acts as a reinforcer, making the behavior more likely to occur again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s04_p04">Sufferers of OCD may avoid certain places that trigger the obsessive thoughts, or use alcohol or drugs to try to calm themselves down. OCD has a low prevalence rate (about 1% of the population in a given year) in relation to other anxiety disorders, and usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood (Horwath &amp; Weissman, 2000; Samuels &amp; Nestadt, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_038">Horwath, E., &amp; Weissman, M.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Explaining Anxiety and Dissociation Disorders</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p01">Both nature and nurture contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. In terms of our evolutionary experiences, humans have evolved to fear dangerous situations. Those of us who had a healthy fear of the dark, of storms, of high places, of closed spaces, and of spiders and snakes were more likely to survive and have descendants. Our evolutionary experience can account for some modern fears as well. A fear of elevators may be a modern version of our fear of closed spaces, while a fear of flying may be related to a fear of heights.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p02">Also supporting the role of biology, anxiety disorders, including PTSD, are heritable (Hettema, Neale, &amp; Kendler, 2001),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_055">Hettema, J. M., Neale, M. C., &amp; Kendler, K. S. (2001). A review and meta-analysis of the genetic epidemiology of anxiety disorders. <em class="emphasis">The American Journal of Psychiatry, 158</em>(10), 1568–1578.</span> and molecular genetics studies have found a variety of genes that are important in the expression of such disorders (Smoller et al., 2008; Thoeringer et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_056">Smoller, J., Paulus, M., Fagerness, J., Purcell, S., Yamaki, L., Hirshfeld-Becker, D.,…Stein, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p03">Whether the genetic predisposition to anxiety becomes expressed as a disorder depends on environmental factors. People who were abused in childhood are more likely to be anxious than those who had normal childhoods, even with the same genetic disposition to anxiety sensitivity (Stein, Schork, &amp; Gelernter, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_059">Stein, M., Schork, N., &amp; Gelernter, J. (2008). Gene-by-environment (serotonin transporter and childhood maltreatment) interaction for anxiety sensitivity, an intermediate phenotype for anxiety disorders. <em class="emphasis">Neuropsychopharmacology, 33</em>(2), 312–319. doi:10.1038/sj.npp.1301422</span> And the most severe anxiety and dissociative disorders, such as PTSD, are usually triggered by the experience of a major stressful event. One problem is that modern life creates a lot of anxiety. Although our life expectancy and quality of life have improved over the past 50 years, the same period has also created a sharp increase in anxiety levels (Twenge, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_060">Twenge, J. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Generation me</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span> These changes suggest that most anxiety disorders stem from perceived, rather than actual, threats to our well-being.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p04">Anxieties are also learned through classical and operant conditioning. Just as rats that are shocked in their cages develop a chronic anxiety toward their laboratory environment (which has become a conditioned stimulus for fear), rape victims may feel anxiety when passing by the scene of the crime, and victims of PTSD may react to memories or reminders of the stressful event. Classical conditioning may also be accompanied by <em class="emphasis">stimulus generalization</em>. A single dog bite can lead to generalized fear of all dogs; a panic attack that follows an embarrassing moment in one place may be generalized to a fear of all public places. People’s responses to their anxieties are often reinforced. Behaviors become compulsive because they provide relief from the torment of anxious thoughts. Similarly, leaving or avoiding fear-inducing stimuli leads to feelings of calmness or relief, which reinforces phobic behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s02_s07_p05">In contrast to the anxiety disorders, the causes of the dissociative orders are less clear, which is part of the reason that there is disagreement about their existence. Unlike most psychological orders, there is little evidence of a genetic predisposition; they seem to be almost entirely environmentally determined. Severe emotional trauma during childhood, such as physical or sexual abuse, coupled with a strong stressor, is typically cited as the underlying cause (Alpher, 1992; Cardeña &amp; Gleaves, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_061">Alpher, V.
