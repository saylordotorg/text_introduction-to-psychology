    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_p01">One important aspect of social cognition involves forming impressions of other people. Making these judgments quickly and accurately helps us guide our behavior to interact appropriately with the people we know. If we can figure out why our roommate is angry at us, we can react to resolve the problem; if we can determine how to motivate the people in our group to work harder on a project, then the project might be better.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Perceiving Others</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s01_p01">Our initial judgments of others are based in large part on what we see. The physical features of other people, particularly their sex, race, age, and physical attractiveness, are very salient, and we often focus our attention on these dimensions (Schneider, 2003; Zebrowitz &amp; Montepare, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_004">Schneider, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s01_p02">Although it may seem inappropriate or shallow to admit it, we are strongly influenced by the physical attractiveness of others, and many cases physical attractiveness is the most important determinant of our initial liking for other people (Walster, Aronson, Abrahams, &amp; Rottmann, 1966).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_005">Walster, E., Aronson, V., Abrahams, D., &amp; Rottmann, L.

Facial diversity and infant preferences for attractive faces. <em class="emphasis">Developmental Psychology, 27</em>(1), 79–84.</span> Evolutionary psychologists have argued that our belief that “what is beautiful is also good” may be because we use attractiveness as a cue for health; people whom we find more attractive may also, evolutionarily, have been healthier (Zebrowitz, Fellous, Mignault, &amp; Andreoletti, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_007">Zebrowitz, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s01_p04">Another indicator of health is symmetry. People are more attracted to faces that are more symmetrical than they are to those that are less symmetrical, and this may be due in part to the perception that symmetrical faces are perceived as healthier (Rhodes et al., 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_009">Rhodes, G., Zebrowitz, L. A., Clark, A., Kalick, S. M., Hightower, A., &amp; McKay, R. (2001). Do facial averageness and symmetry signal health? <em class="emphasis">Evolution and Human Behavior, 22</em>(1), 31–46.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s01_p05">Although you might think that we would prefer faces that are unusual or unique, in fact the opposite is true. Langlois and Roggman (1990)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_010">Langlois, J. H., &amp; Roggman, L. A. (1990). Attractive faces are only average. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 1</em>(2), 115–121.</span> showed college students the faces of men and women. The faces were composites made up of the average of 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 faces. The researchers found that the more faces that were averaged into the stimulus, the more attractive it was judged. Again, our liking for average faces may be because they appear healthier.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s01_p06">Although preferences for youthful, symmetrical, and average faces have been observed cross-culturally, and thus appear to be common human preferences, different cultures may also have unique beliefs about what is attractive. In modern Western cultures, “thin is in,” and people prefer those who have little excess fat (Crandall, Merman, &amp; Hebl, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_011">Crandall, C. S., Merman, A., &amp; Hebl, M. (2009). Anti-fat prejudice. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination</em> (pp. 469–487). New York, NY: Psychology Press.</span> The need to be thin to be attractive is particularly strong for women in contemporary society, and the desire to maintain a low body weight can lead to low self-esteem, eating disorders, and other unhealthy behaviors. However, the norm of thinness has not always been in place; the preference for women with slender, masculine, and athletic looks has become stronger over the past 50 years. In contrast to the relatively universal preferences for youth, symmetry, and averageness, other cultures do not show such a strong propensity for thinness (Sugiyama, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_012">Sugiyama, L.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Forming Judgments on the Basis of Appearance: Stereotyping, Prejudice, and Discrimination</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s02_p01">We frequently use people’s appearances to form our judgments about them and to determine our responses to them. The <em class="emphasis">tendency to attribute personality characteristics to people on the basis of their external appearance or their social group memberships</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotyping</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to attribute personality characteristics to people on the basis of their external appearance or their social group memberships.</span></span>. Our stereotypes about physically attractive people lead us to see them as more dominant, sexually warm, mentally healthy, intelligent, and socially skilled than we perceive physically unattractive people (Langlois et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_013">Langlois, J.

A meta-analytic and theoretical review. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 126</em>(3), 390–423.</span> And our stereotypes lead us to treat people differently—the physically attractive are given better grades on essay exams, are more successful on job interviews, and receive lighter sentences in court judgments than their less attractive counterparts (Hosoda, Stone-Romero, &amp; Coats, 2003; Zebrowitz &amp; McDonald, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_014">Hosoda, M., Stone-Romero, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s02_p02">In addition to stereotypes about physical attractiveness, we also regularly stereotype people on the basis of their sex, race, age, religion, and many other characteristics, and these stereotypes are frequently negative (Schneider, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_015">Schneider, D. J. (2004). <em class="emphasis">The psychology of stereotyping</em>. New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> Stereotyping is unfair to the people we judge because stereotypes are based on our preconceptions and negative emotions about the members of the group. Stereotyping is closely related to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prejudice</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to dislike people because of their appearance or group memberships.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the tendency to dislike people because of their appearance or group memberships</em>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">discrimination</a><span class="glossdef">Negative behaviors toward others based on prejudice.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">negative behaviors toward others based on prejudice.</em> Stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination work together. We may not vote for a gay person for public office because of our negative stereotypes about gays, and we may avoid people from other religions or those with mental illness because of our prejudices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s02_p03">Some stereotypes may be accurate in part. Research has found, for instance, that attractive people are actually more sociable, more popular, and less lonely than less attractive individuals (Langlois et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_016">Langlois, J. H., Kalakanis, L., Rubenstein, A. J., Larson, A., Hallam, M., &amp; Smoot, M. (2000). Maxims or myths of beauty? A meta-analytic and theoretical review. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 126</em>(3), 390–423.</span> And, consistent with the stereotype that women are “emotional,” women are, on average, more empathic and attuned to the emotions of others than are men (Hall &amp; Schmid Mast, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_017">Hall, J. A., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2008). Are women always more interpersonally sensitive than men? Impact of goals and content domain. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34</em>(1), 144–155.</span> Group differences in personality traits may occur in part because people act toward others on the basis of their stereotypes, creating a <em class="emphasis">self-fulfilling prophecy</em>.

If I have a stereotype that attractive people are friendly, then I may act in a friendly way toward people who are attractive. This friendly behavior may be reciprocated by the attractive person, and if many other people also engage in the same positive behaviors with the person, in the long run he or she may actually become friendlier.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s02_p04">But even if attractive people are on average friendlier than unattractive people, not all attractive people are friendlier than all unattractive people. And even if women are, on average, more emotional than men, not all men are less emotional than all women. Social psychologists believe that it is better to treat people as individuals rather than rely on our stereotypes and prejudices, because stereotyping and prejudice are always unfair and often inaccurate (Fiske, 1989; Stangor, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_018">Fiske, S.

We may be evolutionarily disposed to stereotyping. Because our primitive ancestors needed to accurately separate members of their own kin group from those of others, categorizing people into “us” (the <em class="emphasis">ingroup</em>) and “them” (the <em class="emphasis">outgroup</em>) was useful and even necessary (Neuberg, Kenrick, &amp; Schaller, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_019">Neuberg, S.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Close Relationships</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p01">One of the most important tasks faced by humans is to develop successful relationships with others. These relationships include acquaintanceships and friendships but also the more important <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">close relationships</a><span class="glossdef">Long-term intimate and romantic relationships—for instance, a marriage.</span></span>, which are <em class="emphasis">the long-term intimate and romantic relationships that we develop with another person—for instance, in a marriage</em> (Hendrick &amp; Hendrick, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_030">Hendrick, C., &amp; Hendrick, S. S. (Eds.). (2000). <em class="emphasis">Close relationships: A sourcebook</em>. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</span> Because most of us will want to enter into a close relationship at some point, and because close relationships are evolutionarily important as they form the basis for effective child rearing, it is useful to know what psychologists have learned about the principles of liking and loving within them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p02">A major interest of social psychologists is the study of <em class="emphasis">interpersonal attraction</em>, or what makes people like, and even love, each other. One important factor is a perceived similarity in values and beliefs between the partners (Davis &amp; Rusbult, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_031">Davis, J. L., &amp; Rusbult, C. E. (2001). Attitude alignment in close relationships. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 81</em>(1), 65–84.</span> Similarity is important for relationships both because it is more convenient (it’s easier if both partners like to ski or go to the movies than if only one does), but also because similarity supports our values—I can feel better about myself and my choice of activities if I see that you also enjoy doing the same things that I do.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p03">Liking is also enhanced by <em class="emphasis">self-disclosure</em>, the tendency to communicate frequently, without fear of reprisal, and in an accepting and empathetic manner. Friends are friends because we can talk to them openly about our needs and goals, and because they listen to and respond to our needs (Reis &amp; Aron, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_032">Reis, H. T., &amp; Aron, A. (2008). Love: What is it, why does it matter, and how does it operate? <em class="emphasis">Perspectives on Psychological Science, 3</em>(1), 80–86.</span> But self-disclosure must be balanced. If I open up to you about the concerns that are important to me, I expect you to do the same in return. If the self-disclosure is not reciprocal, the relationship may not last.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p04">Another important determinant of liking is <em class="emphasis">proximity</em>, or the extent to which people are physically near us. Research has found that we are more likely to develop friendships with people who are nearby, for instance, those who live in the same dorm that we do, and even with people who just happen to sit nearer to us in our classes (Back, Schmukle, &amp; Egloff, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_033">Back, M. D., Schmukle, S. C., &amp; Egloff, B. (2008). Becoming friends by chance. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 19</em>(5), 439–440.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p05">Proximity has its effect on liking through the principle of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mere exposure</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to prefer stimuli (including but not limited to people) that we have seen more frequently.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">the tendency to prefer stimuli (including but not limited to people) that we have seen more frequently</em>.

Exposure effects in the classroom: The development of affinity among students. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 28</em>(3), 255–276.</span> studied mere exposure by having female confederates attend a large lecture class of over 100 students 0, 5, 10, or 15 times during a semester. At the end of the term, the other students in the class were shown pictures of the confederates and asked to indicate both if they recognized them and also how much they liked them. The number of times the confederates had attended class didn’t influence the other students’ ability to recognize them, but it did influence their liking for them. As predicted by the mere exposure hypothesis, students who had attended class more often were liked more (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch14_s01_s03_f02">Figure 14.5 "Mere Exposure in the Classroom"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p06">The effect of mere exposure is powerful and occurs in a wide variety of situations. Infants tend to smile at a photograph of someone they have seen before more than they smile at a photograph of someone they are seeing for the first time (Brooks-Gunn &amp; Lewis, 1981),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_035">Brooks-Gunn, J., &amp; Lewis, M. (1981). Infant social perception: Responses to pictures of parents and strangers. <em class="emphasis">Developmental Psychology, 17</em>(5), 647–649.</span> and people prefer side-to-side reversed images of their own faces over their normal (nonreversed) face, whereas their friends prefer their normal face over the reversed one (Mita, Dermer, &amp; Knight, 1977).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_036">Mita, T. H., Dermer, M., &amp; Knight, J. (1977). Reversed facial images and the mere-exposure hypothesis. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 35</em>(8), 597–601.</span> This is expected on the basis of mere exposure, since people see their own faces primarily in mirrors and thus are exposed to the reversed face more often.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p07">Mere exposure may well have an evolutionary basis. We have an initial fear of the unknown, but as things become more familiar they seem more similar and safe, and thus produce more positive affect and seem less threatening and dangerous (Freitas, Azizian, Travers, &amp; Berry, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_037">Freitas, A. L., Azizian, A., Travers, S., &amp; Berry, S. A. (2005). The evaluative connotation of processing fluency: Inherently positive or moderated by motivational context? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 41</em>(6), 636–644.</span> In fact, research has found that stimuli tend to produce more positive affect as they become more familiar (Harmon-Jones &amp; Allen, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_038">Harmon-Jones, E., &amp; Allen, J. J. B. (2001). The role of affect in the mere exposure effect: Evidence from psychophysiological and individual differences approaches. <em class="emphasis">Personality &amp; Social Psychology Bulletin, 27</em>(7), 889–898.</span> When the stimuli are people, there may well be an added effect. Familiar people become more likely to be seen as part of the ingroup rather than the outgroup, and this may lead us to like them more. Leslie Zebrowitz and her colleagues found that we like people of our own race in part because they are perceived as similar to us (Zebrowitz, Bornstad, &amp; Lee, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_039">Zebrowitz, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p08">In the most successful relationships the two people begin to see themselves as a single unit. Arthur Aron and his colleagues (Aron, Aron, &amp; Smollan, 1992)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_040">Aron, A., Aron, E. N., &amp; Smollan, D. (1992). Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 63</em>(4), 596–612.</span> assessed the role of closeness in relationships using the <em class="emphasis">Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale</em> as shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch14_s01_s03_f03">Figure 14.6 "The Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale"</a>. You might try completing the measure yourself for some different people that you know—for instance, your family members, friends, spouse, or girlfriend or boyfriend. The measure is simple to use and to interpret; if people see the circles representing the self and the other as more overlapping, this means that the relationship is close. But if they choose the circles that are less overlapping, then the relationship is less so.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p09">Although the closeness measure is very simple, it has been found to be predictive of people’s satisfaction with their close relationships, and of the tendency for couples to stay together (Aron, Aron, Tudor, &amp; Nelson, 1991; Aron, Paris, &amp; Aron, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_041">Aron, A., Aron, E.

Falling in love: Prospective studies of self-concept change. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 69</em>(6), 1102–1112.</span> When the partners in a relationship feel that they are close, and when they indicate that the relationship is based on caring, warmth, acceptance and social support, we can say that the relationship is <em class="emphasis">intimate</em> (Reis &amp; Aron, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_042">Reis, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p10">When a couple begins to take care of a household together, has children, and perhaps has to care for elderly parents, the requirements of the relationship become correspondingly bigger. As a result of this complexity, the partners in close relationships increasingly turn to each other for help in coordinating activities, remembering dates and appointments, and accomplishing tasks. Relationships are close in part because the couple becomes highly <em class="emphasis">interdependent</em>, relying on each other to meet important goals (Berscheid &amp; Reis, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_043">Berscheid, E., &amp; Reis, H.

New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p11">In relationships in which a positive rapport between the partners is developed and maintained over a period of time, the partners are naturally happy with the relationship and they become committed to it. <em class="emphasis">Commitment</em> refers to the feelings and actions that keep partners working together to maintain the relationship (Rusbult, Olsen, Davis, Hannon, 2001)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_044">Rusbult, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p12">People also find relationships more satisfactory, and stay in them longer, when they feel that they are being rewarded by them. When the needs of either or both of the partners are not being met, the relationship is in trouble. This is not to say that people only think about the benefits they are getting; they will also consider the needs of the other. But over the long term, both partners must benefit from the relationship.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s03_p13">Although sexual arousal and excitement are more important early on in relationships, intimacy is also determined by sexual and romantic attraction. Indeed, intimacy is also dependent on <em class="emphasis">passion—</em>the partners must display positive affect toward each other. Happy couples are in positive moods when they are around each other; they laugh with each other, express approval rather than criticism of each other’s behaviors, and enjoy physical contact. People are happier in their relationships when they view the other person in a positive or even an “idealized” sense, rather than a more realistic and perhaps more negative one (Murray, Holmes, &amp; Griffin, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_047">Murray, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s04_p01">When we observe people’s behavior we may attempt to determine if the behavior really reflects their underlying personality. If Frank hits Joe, we might wonder if Frank is naturally aggressive or if perhaps Joe had provoked him. If Leslie leaves a big tip for the waitress, we might wonder if she is a generous person or if the service was particularly excellent. <em class="emphasis">The process of trying to determine the causes of people’s behavior, with the goal of learning about their personalities</em>, is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">causal attribution</a><span class="glossdef">The process of trying to determine the causes of people’s behavior, with the goal of learning about their personalities.</span></span> (Jones et al., 1987).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_049">Jones, E. E., Kanouse, D. E., Kelley, H. H., Nisbett, R. E., Valins, S., &amp; Weiner, B. (Eds.). (1987). <em class="emphasis">Attribution: Perceiving the causes of behavior</em>. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s04_p02">Making causal attributions is a bit like conducting an experiment. We carefully observe the people we are interested in and note how they behave in different social situations. After we have made our observations, we draw our conclusions. Sometimes we may decide that the behavior was caused primarily by the person; this is called making a <em class="emphasis">person attribution</em>. At other times, we may determine that the behavior was caused primarily by the situation; this is called making a <em class="emphasis">situation attribution.</em> And at other times we may decide that the behavior was caused by both the person and the situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s04_p03">It is easier to make personal attributions when behavior is more unusual or unexpected. Imagine that you go to a party and you are introduced to Tess. Tess shakes your hand and says “Nice to meet you!” Can you readily conclude, on the basis of this behavior, that Tess is a friendly person? Probably not. Because the social situation demands that people act in a friendly way (shaking your hand and saying “nice to meet you”), it is difficult to know whether Tess acted friendly because of the situation or because she is really friendly. Imagine, however, that instead of shaking your hand, Tess sticks out her tongue at you and walks away. I think you would agree that it is easier in this case to infer that Tess is unfriendly because her behavior is so contrary to what one would expect (Jones, Davis, &amp; Gergen, 1961).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_050">Jones, E. E., Davis, K. E., &amp; Gergen, K. J. (1961). Role playing variations and their informational value for person perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal &amp; Social Psychology, 63</em>(2), 302–310.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s04_p04">Although people are reasonably accurate in their attributions (we could say, perhaps, that they are “good enough”; Fiske, 2003),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_051">Fiske, S. T. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Social beings</em>. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.</span> they are far from perfect. One error that we frequently make when making judgments about ourselves is to make <em class="emphasis">self-serving attributions</em> by judging the causes of our own behaviors in overly positive ways. If you did well on a test, you will probably attribute that success to person causes (“I’m smart,” “I studied really hard”), but if you do poorly on the test you are more likely to make situation attributions (“The test was hard,” “I had bad luck”). Although making causal attributions is expected to be logical and scientific, our emotions are not irrelevant.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s04_p05">Another way that our attributions are often inaccurate is that we are, by and large, too quick to attribute the behavior of other people to something personal about them rather than to something about their situation. We are more likely to say, “Leslie left a big tip, so she must be generous” than “Leslie left a big tip, but perhaps that was because the service was really excellent.” <em class="emphasis">The common tendency to overestimate the role of person factors and overlook the impact of situations in judging others</em> is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fundamental attribution error (or correspondence bias)</a><span class="glossdef">The common tendency to overestimate the role of person factors and overlook the impact of social situations in judging others.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s04_p06">The fundamental attribution error occurs in part because other people are so salient in our social environments. When I look at you, I see you as my focus, and so I am likely to make personal attributions about you. If the situation is reversed such that people see situations from the perspectives of others, the fundamental attribution error is reduced (Storms, 1973).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_052">Storms, M. D. (1973). Videotape and the attribution process: Reversing actors’ and observers’ points of view. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 27</em>(2), 165–175.</span> And when we judge people, we often see them in only one situation. It’s easy for you to think that your math professor is “picky and detail-oriented” because that describes her behavior in class, but you don’t know how she acts with her friends and family, which might be completely different. And we also tend to make person attributions because they are easy. We are more likely to commit the fundamental attribution error—quickly jumping to the conclusion that behavior is caused by underlying personality—when we are tired, distracted, or busy doing other things (Trope &amp; Alfieri, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_053">Trope, Y., &amp; Alfieri, T. (1997). Effortfulness and flexibility of dispositional judgment processes. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73</em>(4), 662–674.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s04_p07">An important moral about perceiving others applies here: <em class="emphasis">We should not be too quick to judge other people.</em> It is easy to think that poor people are lazy, that people who say something harsh are rude or unfriendly, and that all terrorists are insane madmen. But these attributions may frequently overemphasize the role of the person, resulting in an inappropriate and inaccurate tendency to <em class="emphasis">blame the victim</em> (Lerner, 1980; Tennen &amp; Affleck, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_054">Lerner, M.

Blaming others for threatening events. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 108</em>(2), 209–232.</span> Sometimes people are lazy and rude, and some terrorists are probably insane, but these people may also be influenced by the situation in which they find themselves. Poor people may find it more difficult to get work and education because of the environment they grow up in, people may say rude things because they are feeling threatened or are in pain, and terrorists may have learned in their family and school that committing violence in the service of their beliefs is justified. When you find yourself making strong person attributions for the behaviors of others, I hope you will stop and think more carefully. Would you want other people to make person attributions for your behavior in the same situation, or would you prefer that they more fully consider the situation surrounding your behavior? Are you perhaps making the fundamental attribution error?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p03">Attitudes predict behavior better for some people than for others.

W., &amp; Snyder, M. (2000). Self-monitoring: Appraisal and reappraisal. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 126</em>(4), 530–555.</span> High self-monitors agree with statements such as, “In different situations and with different people, I often act like very different persons” and “I guess I put on a show to impress or entertain people.” Attitudes are more likely to predict behavior for low self-monitors, who are more likely to act on their own attitudes even when the social situation suggests that they should behave otherwise. Low self-monitors are more likely to agree with statements such as “At parties and social gatherings, I do not attempt to do or say things that others will like” and “I can only argue for ideas that I already believe.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p04">The match between the social situations in which the attitudes are expressed and the behaviors are engaged in also matters, such that there is a greater attitude-behavior correlation when the social situations match. Imagine for a minute the case of Magritte, a 16-year-old high school student. Magritte tells her parents that she hates the idea of smoking cigarettes. But how sure are you that Magritte’s attitude will predict her behavior? Would you be willing to bet that she’d never try smoking when she’s out with her friends?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p05">The problem here is that Magritte’s attitude is being expressed in one social situation (when she is with her parents) whereas the behavior (trying a cigarette) is going to occur in a very different social situation (when she is out with her friends). The relevant social norms are, of course, much different in the two situations. Magritte’s friends might be able to convince her to try smoking, despite her initial negative attitude, by enticing her with peer pressure. Behaviors are more likely to be consistent with attitudes when the social situation in which the behavior occurs is similar to the situation in which the attitude is expressed (Ajzen, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_060">Ajzen, I. (1991). The theory of planned behavior. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Decision Processes, 50</em>(2), 179–211.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p06">Although it might not have surprised you to hear that our attitudes predict our behaviors, you might be more surprised to learn that our behaviors also have an influence on our attitudes. It makes sense that if I like Frosted Flakes I’ll buy them, because my positive attitude toward the product influences my behavior. But my attitudes toward Frosted Flakes may also become more positive if I decide—for whatever reason—to buy some. It makes sense that Charlie’s love for Charlene will lead him to propose marriage, but it is also the case that he will likely love Charlene even more after he does so.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p07">Behaviors influence attitudes in part through the process of <em class="emphasis">self-perception.</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-perception</a><span class="glossdef">Using our behavior to help us determine our own thoughts and feelings.</span></span> occurs <em class="emphasis">when we use our own behavior as a guide to help us determine our own thoughts and feelings</em> (Bem, 1972; Olson &amp; Stone, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_061">Bem, D.

The participants who had shaken their heads up and down later agreed with the content of the editorials more than the people who had shaken them side to side.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p08">Persuaders may use the principles of self-perception to change attitudes. The <em class="emphasis">foot-in-the-door technique</em> is a method of persuasion in which the person is first persuaded to accept a rather minor request and then asked for a larger one after that. In one demonstration, Guéguen and Jacob (2002)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_063">Guéguen, N., &amp; Jacob, C. (2002). Solicitation by e-mail and solicitor’s status: A field study of social influence on the web. <em class="emphasis">CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior, 5</em>(4), 377–383.</span> found that students in a computer discussion group were more likely to volunteer to complete a 40-question survey on their food habits (which required 15 to 20 minutes of their time) if they had already, a few minutes earlier, agreed to help the same requestor with a simple computer-related question (about how to convert a file type) than if they had not first been given the smaller opportunity to help. The idea is that when asked the second time, the people looked at their past behavior (having agreed to the small request) and inferred that they are helpful people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p09">Behavior also influences our attitudes through a more emotional process known as <em class="emphasis">cognitive dissonance.</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive dissonance</a><span class="glossdef">The discomfort we experience when we choose to behave in ways that we see as inappropriate, and which leads our behavior to change our attitudes.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the discomfort we experience when we choose to behave in ways that we see as inappropriate</em> (Festinger, 1957; Harmon-Jones &amp; Mills, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_064">Festinger, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p10">Elliot Aronson and Judson Mills (1959)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn14_065">Aronson, E., &amp; Mills, J. (1959). The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59</em>, 171–181.</span> studied whether the cognitive dissonance created by an initiation process could explain how much commitment students felt to a group that they were part of. In their experiment, female college students volunteered to join a group that would be meeting regularly to discuss various aspects of the psychology of sex. According to random assignment, some of the women were told that they would be required to perform an embarrassing procedure (they were asked to read some obscene words and some sexually oriented passages from a novel in public) before they could join the group, whereas other women did not have to go through this initiation. Then all the women got a chance to listen to the group’s conversation, which turned out to be very boring.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p11">Aronson and Mills found that the women who had gone through the embarrassing experience subsequently reported more liking for the group than those who had not. They argued that the more effort an individual expends to become a member of the group (e.g., a severe initiation), the more they will become committed to the group, to justify the effort they have put in during the initiation. The idea is that the effort creates dissonant cognitions (“I did all this work to join the group”), which are then justified by creating more consonant ones (“OK, this group is really pretty fun”). Thus the women who spent little effort to get into the group were able to see the group as the dull and boring conversation that it was. The women who went through the more severe initiation, however, succeeded in convincing themselves that the same discussion was a worthwhile experience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch14_s01_s05_p12">When we put in effort for something—an initiation, a big purchase price, or even some of our precious time—we will likely end up liking the activity more than we would have if the effort had been less; not doing so would lead us to experience the unpleasant feelings of dissonance. After we buy a product, we convince ourselves that we made the right choice because the product is excellent. If we fail to lose the weight we wanted to, we decide that we look good anyway. If we hurt someone else’s feelings, we may even decide that he or she is a bad person who deserves our negative behavior. To escape from feeling poorly about themselves, people will engage in quite extraordinary rationalizing. No wonder that most of us believe that “If I had it all to do over again, I would not change anything important.”</p>

                <li>Social psychology is the scientific study of how we influence, and are influenced by, the people around us.</li>
                <li>Social cognition involves forming impressions of ourselves and other people. Doing so quickly and accurately is functional for social life.</li>
                <li>Our initial judgments of others are based in large part on what we see. The physical features of other people—and particularly their sex, race, age, and physical attractiveness—are very salient, and we often focus our attention on these dimensions.</li>
                <li>We are attracted to people who appear to be healthy. Indicators of health include youth, symmetry, and averageness.</li>
                <li>We frequently use people’s appearances to form our judgments about them, and to determine our responses to them. These responses include stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. Social psychologists believe that people should get past their prejudices and judge people as individuals.</li>
                <li>Close relationships are based on intimacy. Intimacy is determined by similarity, self-disclosure, interdependence, commitment, rewards, and passion.</li>
                <li>Causal attribution is the process of trying to determine the causes of people’s behavior with the goal of learning about their personalities. Although people are reasonably accurate in their attributions, they also succumb to biases such as the fundamental attribution error.</li>
                <li>Attitudes refer to our relatively enduring evaluations of people and things. Attitudes are determined in part by genetic transmission from our parents and in part through direct and indirect experiences.</li>
                <li>Although attitudes predict behaviors, behaviors also predict attitudes. This occurs through the processes of self-perception and cognitive dissonance.</li>
