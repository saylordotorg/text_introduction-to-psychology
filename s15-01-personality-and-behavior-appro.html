    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_p01">Early theories assumed that personality was expressed in people’s physical appearance. One early approach, developed by the German physician Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) and known as <em class="emphasis">phrenology</em>, was based on the idea that we could measure personality by assessing the patterns of bumps on people’s skulls (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch11_s01_f01">Figure 11.1 "Phrenology"</a>). In the Victorian age, phrenology was taken seriously and many people promoted its use as a source of psychological insight and self-knowledge. Machines were even developed for helping people analyze skulls (Simpson, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_003">Simpson, D. (2005). Phrenology and the neurosciences: Contributions of F. J. Gall and J. G. Spurzheim. <em class="emphasis">ANZ Journal of Surgery, 75</em>(6), 475–482.</span> However, because careful scientific research did not validate the predictions of the theory, phrenology has now been discredited in contemporary psychology.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_p02">Another approach, known as <em class="emphasis">somatology</em>, championed by the psychologist William Herbert Sheldon (1898–1977), was based on the idea that we could determine personality from people’s body types (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch11_s01_f02">Figure 11.2 "Sheldon’s Body Types"</a>). Sheldon (1940)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_004">Sheldon, W. (1940). <em class="emphasis">The varieties of human physique: An introduction to constitutional psychology</em>. New York, NY: Harper.</span> argued that people with more body fat and a rounder physique (“endomorphs”) were more likely to be assertive and bold, whereas thinner people (“ectomorphs”) were more likely to be introverted and intellectual. As with phrenology, scientific research did not validate the predictions of the theory, and somatology has now been discredited in contemporary psychology.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_p03">Another approach to detecting personality is known as <em class="emphasis">physiognomy</em>, or the idea that it is possible to assess personality from facial characteristics. In contrast to phrenology and somatology, for which no research support has been found, contemporary research has found that people are able to detect some aspects of a person’s character—for instance, whether they are gay or straight and whether they are Democrats or Republicans—at above chance levels by looking only at his or her face (Rule &amp; Ambady, 2010; Rule, Ambady, Adams, &amp; Macrae, 2008; Rule, Ambady, &amp; Hallett, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_005">Rule, N. O., &amp; Ambady, N. (2010). Democrats and Republicans can be differentiated from their faces. <em class="emphasis">PLoS ONE, 5</em>(1), e8733; Rule, N. O., Ambady, N., Adams, R. B., Jr., &amp; Macrae, C. N. (2008). Accuracy and awareness in the perception and categorization of male sexual orientation. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95</em>(5), 1019–1028; Rule, N.

Female sexual orientation is perceived accurately, rapidly, and automatically from the face and its features. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45</em>(6), 1245–1251.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_p04">Despite these results, the ability to detect personality from faces is not guaranteed. Olivola and Todorov (2010)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_006">Olivola, C. Y., &amp; Todorov, A. (2010). Fooled by first impressions? Reexamining the diagnostic value of appearance-based inferences. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 46</em>(2), 315–324.</span> recently studied the ability of thousands of people to guess the personality characteristics of hundreds of thousands of faces on the website What’s My Image? (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.whatsmyimage.com">http://www.whatsmyimage.com</a>). In contrast to the predictions of physiognomy, the researchers found that these people would have made more accurate judgments about the strangers if they had just guessed, using their expectations about what people in general are like, rather than trying to use the particular facial features of individuals to help them. It seems then that the predictions of physiognomy may also, in the end, find little empirical support.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Personality as Traits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p01">Personalities are characterized in terms of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">traits</a><span class="glossdef">Relatively enduring characteristics that influence our behavior across many situations.</span></span>, which are <em class="emphasis">relatively enduring characteristics that influence our behavior across many situations</em>. Personality traits such as introversion, friendliness, conscientiousness, honesty, and helpfulness are important because they help explain consistencies in behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p02">The most popular way of measuring traits is by administering personality tests on which people self-report about their own characteristics. Psychologists have investigated hundreds of traits using the self-report approach, and this research has found many personality traits that have important implications for behavior. You can see some examples of the personality dimensions that have been studied by psychologists and their implications for behavior in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch11_s01_s01_t01">Table 11.1 "Some Personality Traits That Predict Behavior"</a>, and you can try completing a trait measure at the website shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch11_s01_s01_n01">Note 11.5 "Example of a Trait Measure"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p03">You can try completing a self-report measure of personality (a short form of the Five-Factor Personality Test) here. There are 120 questions and it should take you about 15–20 minutes to complete. You will receive feedback about your personality after you have finished the test.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p04"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.personalitytest.net/ipip/ipipneo120.htm">http://www.personalitytest.net/ipip/ipipneo120.htm</a></p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p05">As with intelligence tests, the utility of self-report measures of personality depends on their <em class="emphasis">reliability</em> and <em class="emphasis">construct validity</em>. Some popular measures of personality are not useful because they are unreliable or invalid. Perhaps you have heard of a personality test known as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). If so, you are not alone, because the MBTI is the most widely administered personality test in the world, given millions of times a year to employees in thousands of companies. The MBTI categorizes people into one of four categories on each of four dimensions: <em class="emphasis">introversion</em> versus <em class="emphasis">extraversion</em>, <em class="emphasis">sensing</em> versus <em class="emphasis">intuiting</em>, <em class="emphasis">thinking</em> versus <em class="emphasis">feeling</em>, and <em class="emphasis">judging</em> versus <em class="emphasis">perceiving</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p06">Although completing the MBTI can be useful for helping people think about individual differences in personality, and for “breaking the ice” at meetings, the measure itself is not psychologically useful because it is not reliable or valid. People’s classifications change over time, and scores on the MBTI do not relate to other measures of personality or to behavior (Hunsley, Lee, &amp; Wood, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_007">Hunsley, J., Lee, C. M., &amp; Wood, J. M. (2003). Controversial and questionable assessment techniques. In S. O. Lilienfeld, S. J. Lynn, &amp; J. M. Lohr (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Science and pseudoscience in clinical psychology</em> (pp. 39–76). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> Measures such as the MBTI remind us that it is important to scientifically and empirically test the effectiveness of personality tests by assessing their stability over time and their ability to predict behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p07">One of the challenges of the trait approach to personality is that there are so many of them; there are at least 18,000 English words that can be used to describe people (Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_008">Allport, G. W., &amp; Odbert, H. (1936). <em class="emphasis">Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study. No. 211</em>. Princeton, NJ: Psychological Review Monographs.</span> Thus a major goal of psychologists is to take this vast number of descriptors (many of which are very similar to each other) and to determine the underlying important or “core” traits among them (John, Angleitner, &amp; Ostendorf, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_009">John, O. P., Angleitner, A., &amp; Ostendorf, F. (1988). The lexical approach to personality: A historical review of trait taxonomic research. <em class="emphasis">European Journal of Personality, 2</em>(3), 171–203.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p08">The trait approach to personality was pioneered by early psychologists, including Gordon Allport (1897–1967), Raymond Cattell (1905–1998), and Hans Eysenck (1916–1997). Each of these psychologists believed in the idea of the trait as the stable unit of personality, and each attempted to provide a list or taxonomy of the most important trait dimensions. Their approach was to provide people with a self-report measure and then to use statistical analyses to look for the underlying “factors” or “clusters” of traits, according to the frequency and the co-occurrence of traits in the respondents.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p09">Allport (1937)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_010">Allport, G. W. (1937). Personality: A psychological interpretation. New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.</span> began his work by reducing the 18,000 traits to a set of about 4,500 traitlike words that he organized into three levels according to their importance. He called them “cardinal traits” (the most important traits), “central traits” (the basic and most useful traits), and “secondary traits” (the less obvious and less consistent ones). Cattell (1990)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_011">Cattell, R. B. (1990). Advances in Cattellian personality theory. In L. A. Pervin (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of personality: Theory and research</em> (pp. 101–110). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> used a statistical procedure known as <em class="emphasis">factor analysis</em> to analyze the correlations among traits and to identify the most important ones. On the basis of his research he identified what he referred to as “source” (more important) and “surface” (less important) traits, and he developed a measure that assessed 16 dimensions of traits based on personality adjectives taken from everyday language.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p10">Hans Eysenck was particularly interested in the biological and genetic origins of personality and made an important contribution to understanding the nature of a fundamental personality trait: <em class="emphasis">extraversion</em> versus <em class="emphasis">introversion</em> (Eysenck, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_012">Eysenck, H. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Dimensions of personality</em>. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction.</span> Eysenck proposed that people who are extroverted (i.e., who enjoy socializing with others) have lower levels of naturally occurring arousal than do introverts (who are less likely to enjoy being with others). Eysenck argued that extroverts have a greater desire to socialize with others to increase their arousal level, which is naturally too low, whereas introverts, who have naturally high arousal, do not desire to engage in social activities because they are overly stimulating.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p11">The fundamental work on trait dimensions conducted by Allport, Cattell, Eysenck, and many others has led to contemporary trait models, the most important and well-validated of which is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Five-Factor (Big Five) Model of Personality</a><span class="glossdef">The idea that there are five fundamental underlying trait dimensions that are stable across time, cross-culturally shared, and explain a substantial proportion of behavior.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p12">A large body of research evidence has supported the five-factor model. The Big Five dimensions seem to be cross-cultural, because the same five factors have been identified in participants in China, Japan, Italy, Hungary, Turkey, and many other countries (Triandis &amp; Suh, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_014">Triandis, H.

Cultural influences on personality. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Psychology, 53</em>(1), 133–160.</span> The Big Five dimensions also accurately predict behavior. For instance, a pattern of high conscientiousness, low neuroticism, and high agreeableness predicts successful job performance (Tett, Jackson, &amp; Rothstein, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_015">Tett, R.

Assessing the U.S. presidents using the revised NEO Personality Inventory. <em class="emphasis">Assessment, 7</em>(4), 403–420.</span> The Big Five factors are also increasingly being used in helping researchers understand the dimensions of psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression (Oldham, 2010; Saulsman &amp; Page, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_017">Oldham, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s01_p13">An advantage of the five-factor approach is that it is parsimonious. Rather than studying hundreds of traits, researchers can focus on only five underlying dimensions. The Big Five may also capture other dimensions that have been of interest to psychologists. For instance, the trait dimension of <em class="emphasis">need for achievement</em> relates to the Big Five variable of conscientiousness, and <em class="emphasis">self-esteem</em> relates to low neuroticism. On the other hand, the Big Five factors do not seem to capture all the important dimensions of personality. For instance, the Big Five does not capture moral behavior, although this variable is important in many theories of personality. And there is evidence that the Big Five factors are not exactly the same across all cultures (Cheung &amp; Leung, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_018">Cheung, F. M., &amp; Leung, K.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Situational Influences on Personality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p01">One challenge to the trait approach to personality is that traits may not be as stable as we think they are. When we say that Malik is friendly, we mean that Malik is friendly today and will be friendly tomorrow and even next week. And we mean that Malik is friendlier than average in all situations. But what if Malik were found to behave in a friendly way with his family members but to be unfriendly with his fellow classmates? This would clash with the idea that traits are stable across time and situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p02">The psychologist Walter Mischel (1968)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_019">Mischel, W. (1968). <em class="emphasis">Personality and assessment</em>. New York, NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.</span> reviewed the existing literature on traits and found that there was only a relatively low correlation (about <em class="emphasis">r</em> = .30) between the traits that a person expressed in one situation and those that they expressed in other situations. In one relevant study, Hartshorne, May, Maller, &amp; Shuttleworth (1928)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_020">Hartshorne, H., May, M. A., Maller, J. B., Shuttleworth, F. K. (1928). <em class="emphasis">Studies in the nature of character</em>. New York, NY: Macmillan.</span> examined the correlations among various behavioral indicators of honesty in children. They also enticed children to behave either honestly or dishonestly in different situations, for instance, by making it easy or difficult for them to steal and cheat. The correlations among children’s behavior was low, generally less than <em class="emphasis">r</em> = .30, showing that children who steal in one situation are not always the same children who steal in a different situation. And similar low correlations were found in adults on other measures, including dependency, friendliness, and conscientiousness (Bem &amp; Allen, 1974).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_021">Bem, D. J., &amp; Allen, A. (1974). On predicting some of the people some of the time: The search for cross-situational consistencies in behavior. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 81</em>(6), 506–520.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p03">Psychologists have proposed two possibilities for these low correlations. One possibility is that the natural tendency for people to see traits in others leads us to believe that people have stable personalities when they really do not. In short, perhaps traits are more in the heads of the people who are doing the judging than they are in the behaviors of the people being observed. The fact that people tend to use human personality traits, such as the Big Five, to judge animals in the same way that they use these traits to judge humans is consistent with this idea (Gosling, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_022">Gosling, S. D. (2001). From mice to men: What can we learn about personality from animal research? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 127</em>(1), 45–86.</span> And this idea also fits with research showing that people use their knowledge representation (schemas) about people to help them interpret the world around them and that these schemas color their judgments of others’ personalities (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_023">Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Social cognition, from brains to culture</em>. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p04">Research has also shown that people tend to see more traits in other people than they do in themselves. You might be able to get a feeling for this by taking the following short quiz. First, think about a person you know—your mom, your roommate, or a classmate—and choose which of the three responses on each of the four lines best describes him or her. Then answer the questions again, but this time about yourself.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p06">The human tendency to perceive traits is so strong that it is very easy to convince people that trait descriptions of themselves are accurate. Imagine that you had completed a personality test and the psychologist administering the measure gave you this description of your personality:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p07">You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity, which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p08">I would imagine that you might find that it described you. You probably do criticize yourself at least sometimes, and you probably do sometimes worry about things. The problem is that you would most likely have found some truth in a personality description that was the opposite. Could this description fit you too?</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p09">You frequently stand up for your own opinions even if it means that others may judge you negatively. You have a tendency to find the positives in your own behavior. You work to the fullest extent of your capabilities. You have few personality weaknesses, but some may show up under stress. You sometimes confide in others that you are concerned or worried, but inside you maintain discipline and self-control. You generally believe that you have made the right decision and done the right thing.</p>

The Barnum effect helps us understand why many people believe in astrology, horoscopes, fortune-telling, palm reading, tarot card reading, and even some personality tests. People are likely to accept descriptions of their personality if they think that they have been written for them, even though they cannot distinguish their own tarot card or horoscope readings from those of others at better than chance levels (Hines, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_025">Hines, T. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Pseudoscience and the paranormal</em> (2nd ed.). Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books.</span> Again, people seem to believe in traits more than they should.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p11">A second way that psychologists responded to Mischel’s findings was by searching even more carefully for the existence of traits. One insight was that the relationship between a trait and a behavior is less than perfect because people can express their traits in different ways (Mischel &amp; Shoda, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_026">Mischel, W., &amp; Shoda, Y.

Pervin (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of personality psychology: Theory and research</em> (3rd ed., pp. 208–241). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> People high in extraversion, for instance, may become teachers, salesmen, actors, or even criminals. Although the behaviors are very different, they nevertheless all fit with the meaning of the underlying trait.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p12">Psychologists also found that, because people do behave differently in different situations, personality will only predict behavior when the behaviors are aggregated or averaged across different situations. We might not be able to use the personality trait of openness to experience to determine what Saul will do on Friday night, but we can use it to predict what he will do over the next year in a variety of situations. When many measurements of behavior are combined, there is much clearer evidence for the stability of traits and for the effects of traits on behavior (Roberts &amp; DelVecchio, 2000; Srivastava, John, Gosling, &amp; Potter, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_027">Roberts, B. W., &amp; DelVecchio, W. F. (2000).

Development of personality in early and middle adulthood: Set like plaster or persistent change? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84</em>(5), 1041–1053.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s02_p13">Taken together, these findings make a very important point about personality, which is that it not only comes from inside us but is also shaped by the situations that we are exposed to. Personality is derived from our interactions with and observations of others, from our interpretations of those interactions and observations, and from our choices of which social situations we prefer to enter or avoid (Bandura, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_028">Bandura, A. (1986). <em class="emphasis">Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory</em>. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> In fact, behaviorists such as B. F. Skinner explain personality entirely in terms of the environmental influences that the person has experienced. Because we are profoundly influenced by the situations that we are exposed to, our behavior does change from situation to situation, making personality less stable than we might expect. And yet personality does matter—we can, in many cases, use personality measures to predict behavior across situations.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p02">To interpret the results, the clinician looks at the pattern of responses across the different subscales and makes a diagnosis about the potential psychological problems facing the patient. Although clinicians prefer to interpret the patterns themselves, a variety of research has demonstrated that computers can often interpret the results as well as can clinicians (Garb, 1998; Karon, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_030">Garb, H.

R. (2006). <em class="emphasis">MMPI-2: Assessing personality and psychopathology</em> (4th ed.). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p03">One potential problem with a measure like the MMPI is that it asks people to consciously report on their inner experiences. But much of our personality is determined by unconscious processes of which we are only vaguely or not at all aware. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Projective measures</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of personality in which unstructured stimuli, such as inkblots, drawings of social situations, or incomplete sentences, are shown to participants, who are asked to freely list what comes to mind as they think about the stimuli.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">measures of personality in which unstructured stimuli, such as inkblots, drawings of social situations, or incomplete sentences, are shown to participants, who are asked to freely list what comes to mind as they think about the stimuli</em>. Experts then score the responses for clues to personality. The proposed advantage of these tests is that they are more indirect—they allow the respondent to freely express whatever comes to mind, including perhaps the contents of their unconscious experiences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p04">One commonly used projective test is the <em class="emphasis">Rorschach Inkblot Test</em>, developed by the Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach (1884–1922). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rorschach Inkblot Test</a><span class="glossdef">A projective measure of personality in which the respondent indicates his or her thoughts about a series of 10 symmetrical inkblots.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a projective measure of personality in which the respondent indicates his or her thoughts about a series of 10 symmetrical inkblots</em> (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch11_s01_s03_f01">Figure 11.5 "Rorschach Inkblots"</a>). The Rorschach is administered millions of time every year. The participants are asked to respond to the inkblots, and their responses are systematically scored in terms of what, where, and why they saw what they saw. For example, people who focus on the details of the inkblots may have obsessive-compulsive tendencies, whereas those who talk about sex or aggression may have sexual or aggressive problems.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p05">Another frequently administered projective test is the <em class="emphasis">Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)</em>, developed by the psychologist Henry Murray (1893–1988). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)</a><span class="glossdef">A projective measure of personality in which the respondent is asked to create stories about sketches of ambiguous situations, most of them of people, either alone or with others.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a projective measure of personality in which the respondent is asked to create stories about sketches of ambiguous situations, most of them of people, either alone or with others</em> (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch11_s01_s03_f02">Figure 11.6 "Sample Card From the TAT"</a>). The sketches are shown to individuals, who are asked to tell a story about what is happening in the picture. The TAT assumes that people may be unwilling or unable to admit their true feelings when asked directly but that these feelings will show up in the stories about the pictures. Trained coders read the stories and use them to develop a personality profile of the respondent.</p>

            <p class="para">This is one of the cards from the TAT. Note that the sex of the figure in the foreground is ambiguous as is the emotional expression of the woman in the background.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p06">Other popular projective tests include those that ask the respondent to draw pictures, such as the Draw-A-Person test (Machover, 1949),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_032">Machover, K. (1949). Personality projection in the drawing of the human figure (A method of personality investigation). In K. Machover (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Personality projection in the drawing of the human figure: A method of personality investigation</em> (pp. 3–32). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas.</span> and free association tests in which the respondent quickly responds with the first word that comes to mind when the examiner says a test word. Another approach is the use of “anatomically correct” dolls that feature representations of the male and female genitals. Investigators allow children to play with the dolls and then try to determine on the basis of the play if the children may have been sexually abused.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p07">The advantage of projective tests is that they are less direct, allowing people to avoid using their defense mechanisms and therefore show their “true” personality. The idea is that when people view ambiguous stimuli they will describe them according to the aspects of personality that are most important to them, and therefore bypass some of the limitations of more conscious responding.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p08">Despite their widespread use, however, the empirical evidence supporting the use of projective tests is mixed (Karon, 2000; Wood, Nezworski, Lilienfeld, &amp; Garb, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_033">Karon, B. P. (2000). The clinical interpretation of the Thematic Apperception Test, Rorschach, and other clinical data: A reexamination of statistical versus clinical prediction. <em class="emphasis">Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 31</em>(2), 230–233; Wood, J. M., Nezworski, M. T., Lilienfeld, S. O., &amp; Garb, H. N. (2003). <em class="emphasis">What’s wrong with the Rorschach? Science confronts the controversial inkblot test</em>. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.</span> The reliability of the measures is low because people often produce very different responses on different occasions. The construct validity of the measures is also suspect because there are very few consistent associations between Rorschach scores or TAT scores and most personality traits. The projective tests often fail to distinguish between people with psychological disorders and those without or to correlate with other measures of personality or with behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p09">In sum, projective tests are more useful as icebreakers to get to know a person better, to make the person feel comfortable, and to get some ideas about topics that may be of importance to that person than for accurately diagnosing personality.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p11">Research has found that being intelligent is an important characteristic of leaders, as long as the leader communicates to others in a way that is easily understood by his or her followers (Simonton, 1994, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_035">Simonton, D.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p12">Because so many characteristics seem to be related to leader skills, some researchers have attempted to account for leadership not in terms of individual traits, but rather in terms of a package of traits that successful leaders seem to have. Some have considered this in terms of charisma (Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1995; Sternberg, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_037">Sternberg, R., &amp; Lubart, T.

Charismatic leaders express views that support and validate existing group norms but that also contain a vision of what the group could or should be. Charismatic leaders use their referent power to motivate, uplift, and inspire others. And research has found a positive relationship between a leader’s charisma and effective leadership performance (Simonton, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_038">Simonton, D. K.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p13">Another trait-based approach to leadership is based on the idea that leaders take either <em class="emphasis">transactional</em> or <em class="emphasis">transformational</em> leadership styles with their subordinates (Bass, 1999; Pieterse, Van Knippenberg, Schippers, &amp; Stam, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_039">Bass, B.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p14">Despite the fact that there appear to be at least some personality traits that relate to leadership ability, the most important approaches to understanding leadership take into consideration both the personality characteristics of the leader as well as the situation in which the leader is operating. In some cases the situation itself is important. For instance, you might remember that President George W. Bush’s ratings as a leader increased dramatically after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. This is a classic example of how a situation can influence the perceptions of a leader’s skill.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_p15">In still other cases, different types of leaders may perform differently in different situations. Leaders whose personalities lead them to be more focused on fostering harmonious social relationships among the members of the group, for instance, are particularly effective in situations in which the group is already functioning well and yet it is important to keep the group members engaged in the task and committed to the group outcomes. Leaders who are more task-oriented and directive, on the other hand, are more effective when the group is not functioning well and needs a firm hand to guide it (Ayman, Chemers, &amp; Fiedler, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn11_040">Ayman, R., Chemers, M.

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch11_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>Personality is an individual’s consistent patterns of feeling, thinking, and behaving.</li>
                <li>Personality is driven in large part by underlying individual motivations, where motivation refers to a need or desire that directs behavior.</li>
                <li>Early theories assumed that personality was expressed in people’s physical appearance. One of these approaches, known as physiognomy, has been validated by current research.</li>
                <li>Personalities are characterized in terms of traits—relatively enduring characteristics that influence our behavior across many situations.</li>
                <li>The most important and well-validated theory about the traits of normal personality is the Five-Factor Model of Personality.</li>
                <li>There is often only a low correlation between the specific traits that a person expresses in one situation and those that he expresses in other situations. This is in part because people tend to see more traits in other people than they do in themselves. Personality predicts behavior better when the behaviors are aggregated or averaged across different situations.</li>
                <li>The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is the most important measure of psychological disorders.</li>
                <li>Projective measures are measures of personality in which unstructured stimuli, such as inkblots, drawings of social situations, or incomplete sentences are shown to participants, who are asked to freely list what comes to mind as they think about the stimuli. Despite their widespread use, however, the empirical evidence supporting the use of projective tests is mixed.</li>
