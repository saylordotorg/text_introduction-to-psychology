    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_p02">Some neurons have hundreds or even thousands of dendrites, and these dendrites may themselves be branched to allow the cell to receive information from thousands of other cells. The axons are also specialized, and some, such as those that send messages from the spinal cord to the muscles in the hands or feet, may be very long—even up to several feet in length. To improve the speed of their communication, and to keep their electrical charges from shorting out with other neurons, axons are often surrounded by a <em class="emphasis">myelin sheath</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p01">The nervous system operates using an <em class="emphasis">electrochemical</em> process (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s01_n01">Note 3.12 "Video Clip: The Electrochemical Action of the Neuron"</a>). An electrical charge moves through the neuron itself and chemicals are used to transmit information between neurons. Within the neuron, when a signal is received by the dendrites, is it transmitted to the soma in the form of an electrical signal, and, if the signal is strong enough, it may then be passed on to the axon and then to the terminal buttons. If the signal reaches the terminal buttons, they are signaled to emit chemicals known as <em class="emphasis">neurotransmitters</em>, which communicate with other neurons across the spaces between the cells, known as <em class="emphasis">synapses</em>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p02">The electrical signal moves through the neuron as a result of changes in the electrical charge of the axon. Normally, the axon remains in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">resting potential</a><span class="glossdef">A state in which the interior of the neuron contains a greater number of negatively charged ions than does the area outside the cell.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a state in which the interior of the neuron contains a greater number of negatively charged ions than does the area outside the cell</em>. When the segment of the axon that is closest to the cell body is stimulated by an electrical signal from the dendrites, and if this electrical signal is strong enough that it passes a certain level or <em class="emphasis">threshold</em>, the cell membrane in this first segment opens its gates, allowing positively charged sodium ions that were previously kept out to enter. This <em class="emphasis">change in electrical charge that occurs in a neuron when a nerve impulse is transmitted</em> is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">action potential</a><span class="glossdef">A change in electrical charge that occurs in a neuron when a nerve impulse is transmitted.</span></span>. Once the action potential occurs, the number of positive ions exceeds the number of negative ions in this segment, and the segment temporarily becomes positively charged.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p03">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 3.4 "The Myelin Sheath and the Nodes of Ranvier"</a>, the axon is segmented by a series of <em class="emphasis">breaks between the sausage-like segments of the myelin sheath</em>. Each of these gaps is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">node of Ranvier</a><span class="glossdef">The break in the myelin sheath of a nerve fiber.</span></span>. The electrical charge moves down the axon from segment to segment, in a set of small jumps, moving from node to node. When the action potential occurs in the first segment of the axon, it quickly creates a similar change in the next segment, which then stimulates the next segment, and so forth as the positive electrical impulse continues all the way down to the end of the axon. As each new segment becomes positive, the membrane in the prior segment closes up again, and the segment returns to its negative resting potential. In this way the action potential is transmitted along the axon, toward the terminal buttons. The entire response along the length of the axon is very fast—it can happen up to 1,000 times each second.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s01_p04">An important aspect of the action potential is that it operates in an <em class="emphasis">all or nothing</em> manner. What this means is that the neuron either fires completely, such that the action potential moves all the way down the axon, or it does not fire at all. Thus neurons can provide more energy to the neurons down the line by firing faster but not by firing more strongly. Furthermore, the neuron is prevented from repeated firing by the presence of a <em class="emphasis">refractory period</em>—a brief time after the firing of the axon in which the axon cannot fire again because the neuron has not yet returned to its resting potential.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p01">Not only do the neural signals travel via electrical charges <em class="emphasis">within</em> the neuron, but they also travel via chemical transmission <em class="emphasis">between</em> the neurons. Neurons are separated by junction areas known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">synapses</a><span class="glossdef">The small gap between neurons across which nerve impulses are transmitted.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">areas where the terminal buttons at the end of the axon of one neuron nearly, but don’t quite, touch the dendrites of another</em>. The synapses provide a remarkable function because they allow each axon to communicate with many dendrites in neighboring cells. Because a neuron may have synaptic connections with thousands of other neurons, the communication links among the neurons in the nervous system allow for a highly sophisticated communication system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p02">When the electrical impulse from the action potential reaches the end of the axon, it signals the terminal buttons to release neurotransmitters into the synapse.

Neurotransmitters travel across the synaptic space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrites of other neurons, where they bind to the dendrites in the neighboring neurons. Furthermore, different terminal buttons release different neurotransmitters, and different dendrites are particularly sensitive to different neurotransmitters. The dendrites will admit the neurotransmitters only if they are the right shape to fit in the receptor sites on the receiving neuron. For this reason, the receptor sites and neurotransmitters are often compared to a lock and key (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s02_f01">Figure 3.5 "The Synapse"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para">When the nerve impulse reaches the terminal button, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. The neurotransmitters fit into receptors on the receiving dendrites in the manner of a lock and key.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p03">When neurotransmitters are accepted by the receptors on the receiving neurons their effect may be either <em class="emphasis">excitatory</em> (i.e., they make the cell more likely to fire) or <em class="emphasis">inhibitory</em> (i.e., they make the cell less likely to fire). Furthermore, if the receiving neuron is able to accept more than one neurotransmitter, then it will be influenced by the excitatory and inhibitory processes of each. If the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitters are greater than the inhibitory influences of the neurotransmitters, the neuron moves closer to its firing threshold, and if it reaches the threshold, the action potential and the process of transferring information through the neuron begins.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p04">Neurotransmitters that are not accepted by the receptor sites must be removed from the synapse in order for the next potential stimulation of the neuron to happen. This process occurs in part through the breaking down of the neurotransmitters by enzymes, and in part through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reuptake</a><span class="glossdef">The process in which the neurotransmitters in the synapse are reabsorbed into the transmitting terminal buttons.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a process in which neurotransmitters that are in the synapse are reabsorbed into the transmitting terminal buttons, ready to again be released after the neuron fires</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p05">More than 100 chemical substances produced in the body have been identified as neurotransmitters, and these substances have a wide and profound effect on emotion, cognition, and behavior. Neurotransmitters regulate our appetite, our memory, our emotions, as well as our muscle action and movement. And as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s01_s02_t01">Table 3.1 "The Major Neurotransmitters and Their Functions"</a>, some neurotransmitters are also associated with psychological and physical diseases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s01_s02_p06">Drugs that we might ingest—either for medical reasons or recreationally—can act like neurotransmitters to influence our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">agonist</a><span class="glossdef">A drug that has chemical properties similar to a particular neurotransmitter and thus mimics the effects of the neurotransmitter.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a drug that has chemical properties similar to a particular neurotransmitter and thus mimics the effects of the neurotransmitter</em>. When an agonist is ingested, it binds to the receptor sites in the dendrites to excite the neuron, acting as if more of the neurotransmitter had been present. As an example, cocaine is an agonist for the neurotransmitter dopamine. Because dopamine produces feelings of pleasure when it is released by neurons, cocaine creates similar feelings when it is ingested. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">antagonist</a><span class="glossdef">A drug that reduces or stops the normal effects of a neurotransmitter.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a drug that reduces or stops the normal effects of a neurotransmitter</em>. When an antagonist is ingested, it binds to the receptor sites in the dendrite, thereby blocking the neurotransmitter. As an example, the poison curare is an antagonist for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. When the poison enters the brain, it binds to the dendrites, stops communication among the neurons, and usually causes death. Still other drugs work by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter itself—when reuptake is reduced by the drug, more neurotransmitter remains in the synapse, increasing its action.</p>
