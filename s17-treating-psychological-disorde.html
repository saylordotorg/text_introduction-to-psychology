        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p01">Lucien Masson, a 60-year-old Vietnam veteran from Arizona, put it simply: “Sascha is the best medicine I’ve ever had.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p02">Lucien is speaking about his friend, companion, and perhaps even his therapist, a Russian wolfhound named Sascha. Lucien suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disorder that has had a profoundly negative impact on his life for many years. His symptoms include panic attacks, nightmares, and road rage. Lucien has tried many solutions, consulting with doctors, psychiatrists, and psychologists, and using a combination of drugs, group therapy, and anger-management classes.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p03">But Sascha seems to be the best therapist of all. He helps out in many ways. If a stranger gets too close to Lucien in public, Sascha will block the stranger with his body. Sascha is trained to sense when Lucien is about to have a nightmare, waking him before it starts. Before road rage can set in, Sascha gently whimpers, reminding his owner that it doesn’t pay to get upset about nutty drivers.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p04">In the same way, former Army medic Jo Hanna Schaffer speaks of her Chihuahua, Cody: “I never took a pill for PTSD that did as much for me as Cody has done.” Persian Gulf War veteran Karen Alexander feels the same way about her Bernese mountain dog, Cindy:</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch13_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p05">She’ll come up and touch me, and that is enough of a stimulus to break the loop, bring me back to reality. Sometimes I’ll scratch my hand until it’s raw and won’t realize until she comes up to me and brings me out. She’s such a grounding influence for me.</p>
        </span>

        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p06">These dramatic stories of improvement from debilitating disorders can be attributed to an alternative psychological therapy, based on established behavioral principles, provided by “psychiatric service dogs.” The dogs are trained to help people with a variety of mental disorders, including panic attacks, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. They help veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan cope with their traumatic brain injuries as well as with PTSD.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p07">The dogs are trained to perform specific behaviors that are helpful to their owners. If the dog’s owner is depressed, the dog will snuggle up and offer physical comfort; if the owner is having a panic attack, the owner can calm himself by massaging the dog’s body. The serenity shown by the dogs in all situations seems to reassure the PTSD sufferer that all must be well. Service dogs are constant, loving companions who provide emotional support and companionship to their embattled, often isolated owners (Shim, 2008; Lorber, 2010; Alaimo, 2010; Schwartz, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_001">Shim, J.

        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_p08">Despite the reports of success from many users, it is important to keep in mind that the utility of psychiatric service dogs has not yet been tested, and thus would never be offered as a therapy by a trained clinician or paid for by an insurance company. Although interaction between humans and dogs can create positive physiological responses (Odendaal, 2000),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_002">Odendaal, J. S. J. (2000). Animal-assisted therapy—Magic or medicine? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 49</em>(4), 275–280.</span> whether the dogs actually help people recover from PTSD is not yet known.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_p09">Psychological disorders create a tremendous individual, social, and economic drain on society. Disorders make it difficult for people to engage in productive lives and effectively contribute to their family and to society. Disorders lead to disability and absenteeism in the workplace, as well as physical problems, premature death, and suicide. At a societal level the costs are staggering. It has been estimated that the annual financial burden of each case of anxiety disorder is over $3,000 per year, meaning that the annual cost of anxiety disorders alone in the United States runs into the trillions of dollars (Konnopka, Leichsenring, Leibing, &amp; König, 2009; Smit et al., 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_003">Konnopka, A., Leichsenring, F., Leibing, E., &amp; König, H.-H.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_p10">The goal of this chapter is to review the techniques that are used to treat psychological disorder. Just as psychologists consider the causes of disorder in terms of the bio-psycho-social model of illness, treatment is also based on psychological, biological, and social approaches.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="stangor-ch13_l01">
        <li>The <em class="emphasis">psychological approach</em> to reducing disorder involves providing help to individuals or families through psychological therapy, including psychoanalysis, humanistic-oriented therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and other approaches.</li>
        <li>The <em class="emphasis">biomedical approach to reducing disorder</em> is based on the use of medications to treat mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety, as well as the employment of brain intervention techniques, including <em class="emphasis">electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</em>, <em class="emphasis">transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</em>, and <em class="emphasis">psychosurgery</em>.</li>
        <li>The <em class="emphasis">social approach to reducing disorder</em> focuses on changing the social environment in which individuals live to reduce the underlying causes of disorder. These approaches include <em class="emphasis">group, couples, and family therapy</em>, as well as <em class="emphasis">community outreach programs</em>. The community approach is likely to be the most effective of the three approaches because it focuses not only on treatment, but also on prevention of disorders (World Health Organization, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_004">World Health Organization. (2004). <em class="emphasis">Prevention of mental disorders: Effective interventions and policy options: Summary report</em>.

</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_p11">A clinician may focus on any or all of the three approaches to treatment, but in making a decision about which to use, he or she will always rely on his or her knowledge about existing empirical tests of the effectiveness of different treatments. These tests, known as <em class="emphasis">outcome studies</em>, carefully compare people who receive a given treatment with people who do not receive a treatment, or with people who receive a different type of treatment. Taken together, these studies have confirmed that many types of therapies are effective in treating disorder.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p01">Treatment for psychological disorder begins when the individual who is experiencing distress visits a counselor or therapist, perhaps in a church, a community center, a hospital, or a private practice. The therapist will begin by systematically learning about the patient’s needs through a formal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">psychological assessment</a><span class="glossdef">An evaluation of the patient’s psychological and mental health.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">an evaluation of the patient’s psychological and mental health</em>. During the assessment the psychologist may give personality tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personal Inventory (MMPI-2) or projective tests, and will conduct a thorough interview with the patient. The therapist may get more information from family members or school personnel.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p02">In addition to the psychological assessment, the patient is usually seen by a physician to gain information about potential Axis III (physical) problems. In some cases of psychological disorder—and particularly for sexual problems—medical treatment is the preferred course of action. For instance, men who are experiencing erectile dysfunction disorder may need surgery to increase blood flow or local injections of muscle relaxants. Or they may be prescribed medications (Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra) that provide an increased blood supply to the penis, which are successful in increasing performance in about 70% of men who take them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p03">After the medical and psychological assessments are completed, the therapist will make a formal diagnosis using the detailed descriptions of the disorder provided in the <em class="emphasis">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<em class="emphasis">DSM</em>; see below). The therapist will summarize the information about the patient on each of the five <em class="emphasis">DSM</em> axes, and the diagnosis will likely be sent to an insurance company to justify payment for the treatment.</p>

The fundamental aspect of psychotherapy is that the patient directly confronts the disorder and works with the therapist to help reduce it. Therapy includes assessing the patient’s issues and problems, planning a course of treatment, setting goals for change, the treatment itself, and an evaluation of the patient’s progress. Therapy is practiced by thousands of psychologists and other trained practitioners in the United States and around the world, and is responsible for billions of dollars of the health budget.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p08">To many people therapy involves a patient lying on a couch with a therapist sitting behind and nodding sagely as the patient speaks.

        <h3 class="title">Psychology in Everyday Life: Seeking Treatment for Psychological Difficulties</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p09">Many people who would benefit from psychotherapy do not get it, either because they do not know how to find it or because they feel that they will be stigmatized and embarrassed if they seek help. The decision to not seek help is a very poor choice because the effectiveness of mental health treatments is well documented and, no matter where a person lives, there are treatments available (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_006">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Mental health: A report of the surgeon general</em>. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p10">The first step in seeking help for psychological problems is to accept the stigma. It is possible that some of your colleagues, friends, and family members will know that you are seeking help and some may at first think more negatively of you for it. But you must get past these unfair and close-minded responses. Feeling good about yourself is the most important thing you can do, and seeking help may be the first step in doing so.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p11">One question is how to determine if someone needs help. This question is not always easy to answer because there is no clear demarcation between “normal” and “abnormal” behavior. Most generally, you will know that you or others need help when the person’s psychological state is negatively influencing his or her everyday behavior, when the behavior is adversely affecting those around the person, and when the problems continue over a period of time. Often people seek therapy as a result of a life-changing event such as diagnosis of a fatal illness, an upcoming marriage or divorce, or the death of a loved one. But therapy is also effective for general depression and anxiety, as well as for specific everyday problems.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p12">There are a wide variety of therapy choices, many of which are free. Begin in your school, community, or church, asking about community health or counseling centers and pastoral counseling. You may want to <em class="emphasis">ask friends and family members for recommendations</em>. You’ll probably be surprised at how many people have been to counseling, and how many recommend it.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p13">There are many therapists who offer a variety of treatment options. Be sure to ask about the degrees that the therapist has earned, and about the reputation of the center in which the therapy occurs. If you have choices, try to find a person or location that you like, respect, and trust. This will allow you to be more open, and you will get more out of the experience. Your sessions with the help provider will require discussing your family history, personality, and relationships, and you should feel comfortable sharing this information.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p14">Remember also that confronting issues requires time to reflect, energy to get to the appointments and deal with consequential feelings, and discipline to explore your issues on your own. Success at therapy is difficult, and it takes effort.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s01_p15">The bottom line is that going for therapy should not be a difficult decision for you. All people have the right to appropriate mental health care just as they have a right to general health care. Just as you go to a dentist for a toothache, you may go to therapy for psychological difficulties. Furthermore, you can be confident that you will be treated with respect and that your privacy will be protected, because therapists follow ethical principles in their practices. The following provides a summary of these principles as developed by the American Psychological Association (2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_007">American Psychological Association.

To help more people benefit, modern psychodynamic approaches frequently use shorter-term, focused, and goal-oriented approaches. In these “brief psychodynamic therapies,” the therapist helps the client determine the important issues to be discussed at the beginning of treatment and usually takes a more active role than in classic psychoanalysis (Levenson, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_009">Levenson, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_p01">Psychodynamic and humanistic therapies are recommended primarily for people suffering from generalized anxiety or mood disorders, and who desire to feel better about themselves overall. But the goals of people with other psychological disorders, such as phobias, sexual problems, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are more specific. A person with a social phobia may want to be able to leave his or her house, a person with a sexual dysfunction may want to improve his or her sex life, and a person with OCD may want to learn to stop letting his obsessions or compulsions interfere with everyday activities. In these cases it is not necessary to revisit childhood experiences or consider our capacities for self-realization—we simply want to deal with what is happening in the present.</p>

As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch13_s01_s03_f01">Figure 13.4 "Cognitive-Behavior Therapy"</a>, CBT is based on the idea that there is a recursive link among our thoughts, our feelings, and our behavior. For instance, if we are feeling depressed, our negative thoughts (“I am doing poorly in my chemistry class”) lead to negative feelings (“I feel hopeless and sad”), which then contribute to negative behaviors (lethargy, disinterest, lack of studying). When we or other people look at the negative behavior, the negative thoughts are reinforced and the cycle repeats itself (Beck, 1976).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_012">Beck, A. T. (1976). <em class="emphasis">Cognitive therapy and the emotional disorders</em>. New York, NY: New American Library.</span> Similarly, in panic disorder a patient may misinterpret his or her feelings of anxiety as a sign of an impending physical or mental catastrophe (such as a heart attack), leading to an avoidance of a particular place or social situation. The fact that the patient is avoiding the situation reinforces the negative thoughts. Again, the thoughts, feelings, and behavior amplify and distort each other.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_p03">CBT is a very broad approach that is used for the treatment of a variety of problems, including mood, anxiety, personality, eating, substance abuse, attention-deficit, and psychotic disorders. CBT treats the symptoms of the disorder (the behaviors or the cognitions) and does not attempt to address the underlying issues that cause the problem. The goal is simply to stop the negative cycle by intervening to change cognition or behavior. The client and the therapist work together to develop the goals of the therapy, the particular ways that the goals will be reached, and the timeline for reaching them. The procedures are problem-solving and action-oriented, and the client is forced to take responsibility for his or her own treatment. The client is assigned tasks to complete that will help improve the disorder and takes an active part in the therapy. The treatment usually lasts between 10 and 20 sessions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_p04">Depending on the particular disorder, some CBT treatments may be primarily behavioral in orientation, focusing on the principles of classical, operant, and observational learning, whereas other treatments are more cognitive, focused on changing negative thoughts related to the disorder. But almost all CBT treatments use a combination of behavioral and cognitive approaches.</p>

The most direct approach is through operant conditioning using reward or punishment. Reinforcement may be used to teach new skills to people, for instance, those with autism or schizophrenia (Granholm et al., 2008; Herbert et al., 2005; Scattone, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_013">Granholm, E., McQuaid, J.

If the patient has trouble interacting with others, reinforcement will be used to teach the client how to more appropriately respond in public, for instance, by maintaining eye contact, smiling when appropriate, and modulating tone of voice.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_s01_p02">As the patient practices the different techniques, the appropriate behaviors are shaped through reinforcement to allow the client to manage more complex social situations. In some cases observational learning may also be used; the client may be asked to observe the behavior of others who are more socially skilled to acquire appropriate behaviors. People who learn to improve their interpersonal skills through skills training may be more accepted by others and this social support may have substantial positive effects on their emotions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_s01_p03">When the disorder is anxiety or phobia, then the goal of the CBT is to reduce the negative affective responses to the feared stimulus. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Exposure therapy</a><span class="glossdef">A behavioral therapy based on the classical conditioning principle of extinction in which people are confronted with a feared stimulus with the goal of decreasing their negative emotional responses to it.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a behavioral therapy based on the classical conditioning principle of extinction, in which people are confronted with a feared stimulus with the goal of decreasing their negative emotional responses to it</em> (Wolpe, 1973).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_014">Wolpe J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_s01_p06">Desensitization techniques use the principle of <em class="emphasis">counterconditioning</em>, in which a second incompatible response (relaxation, e.g., through deep breathing) is conditioned to an already conditioned response (the fear response). The continued pairing of the relaxation responses with the feared stimulus as the patient works up the hierarchy gradually leads the fear response to be extinguished and the relaxation response to take its place.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_s01_p07">Behavioral therapy works best when people directly experience the feared object. Fears of spiders are more directly habituated when the patient interacts with a real spider, and fears of flying are best extinguished when the patient gets on a real plane. But it is often difficult and expensive to create these experiences for the patient. Recent advances in virtual reality have allowed clinicians to provide CBT in what seem like real situations to the patient. In <em class="emphasis">virtual reality CBT</em>, the therapist uses computer-generated, three-dimensional, lifelike images of the feared stimulus in a systematic desensitization program. Specially designed computer equipment, often with a head-mount display, is used to create a simulated environment. A common use is in helping soldiers who are experiencing PTSD return to the scene of the trauma and learn how to cope with the stress it invokes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_s01_p08">Some of the advantages of the virtual reality treatment approach are that it is economical, the treatment session can be held in the therapist’s office with no loss of time or confidentiality, the session can easily be terminated as soon as a patient feels uncomfortable, and many patients who have resisted live exposure to the object of their fears are willing to try the new virtual reality option first.</p>

In cognitive therapy the therapist helps the patient develop new, healthier ways of thinking about themselves and about the others around them. The idea of cognitive therapy is that changing thoughts will change emotions, and that the new emotions will then influence behavior (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch13_s01_s03_f01">Figure 13.4 "Cognitive-Behavior Therapy"</a>).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p02">The goal of cognitive therapy is not necessarily to get people to think more positively but rather to think more accurately. For instance, a person who thinks “no one cares about me” is likely to feel rejected, isolated, and lonely. If the therapist can remind the person that she has a mother or daughter who does care about her, more positive feelings will likely follow. Similarly, changing beliefs from “I have to be perfect” to “No one is always perfect—I’m doing pretty good,” from “I am a terrible student” to “I am doing well in some of my courses,” or from “She did that on purpose to hurt me” to “Maybe she didn’t realize how important it was to me” may all be helpful.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p03">The psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck and the psychologist Albert Ellis (1913–2007) together provided the basic principles of cognitive therapy. Ellis (2004)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_020">Ellis, A. (2004).

Ellis noticed that people experiencing strong negative emotions tend to personalize and overgeneralize their beliefs, leading to an inability to see situations accurately (Leahy, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_021">Leahy, R. L. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Cognitive therapy techniques: A practitioner’s guide</em>.

If a client claims that “everybody at work is out to get me,” the therapist might ask him to provide instances to corroborate the claim.  At the same time the therapist might point out contrary evidence, such as the fact that a certain coworker is actually a loyal friend or that the patient’s boss had recently praised him.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Combination (Eclectic) Approaches to Therapy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p01">To this point we have considered the different approaches to psychotherapy under the assumption that a therapist will use only one approach with a given patient. But this is not the case; as you saw in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch13_s01_f01">Figure 13.2 "The Many Types of Therapy Practiced in the United States"</a>, the most commonly practiced approach to therapy is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eclectic therapy</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to treatment in which the therapist uses whichever techniques seem most useful and relevant for a given patient.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">an approach to treatment in which the therapist uses whichever techniques seem most useful and relevant for a given patient</em>. For bipolar disorder, for instance, the therapist may use both psychological skills training to help the patient cope with the severe highs and lows, but may also suggest that the patient consider biomedical drug therapies (Newman, Leahy, Beck, Reilly-Harrington, &amp; Gyulai, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_023">Newman, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p02">As we have seen in <a class="xref" href="stangor-ch12#stangor-ch12">Chapter 12 "Defining Psychological Disorders"</a>, one of the most commonly diagnosed disorders is borderline personality disorder (BPD). Consider this description, typical of the type of borderline patient who arrives at a therapist’s office:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p03">Even as an infant, it seemed that there was something different about Bethany. She was an intense baby, easily upset and difficult to comfort. She had very severe separation anxiety—if her mother left the room, Bethany would scream until she returned. In her early teens, Bethany became increasingly sullen and angry. She started acting out more and more—yelling at her parents and teachers and engaging in impulsive behavior such as promiscuity and running away from home. At times Bethany would have a close friend at school, but some conflict always developed and the friendship would end.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p04">By the time Bethany turned 17, her mood changes were totally unpredictable. She was fighting with her parents almost daily, and the fights often included violent behavior on Bethany’s part. At times she seemed terrified to be without her mother, but at other times she would leave the house in a fit of rage and not return for a few days. One day, Bethany’s mother noticed scars on Bethany’s arms. When confronted about them, Bethany said that one night she just got more and more lonely and nervous about a recent breakup until she finally stuck a lit cigarette into her arm. She said “I didn’t really care for him that much, but I had to do something dramatic.”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p05">When she was 18 Bethany rented a motel room where she took an overdose of sleeping pills. Her suicide attempt was not successful, but the authorities required that she seek psychological help.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p06">Most therapists will deal with a case such as Bethany’s using an eclectic approach. First, because her negative mood states are so severe, they will likely recommend that she start taking antidepressant medications. These drugs are likely to help her feel better and will reduce the possibility of another suicide attempt, but they will not change the underlying psychological problems. Therefore, the therapist will also provide psychotherapy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p07">The first sessions of the therapy will likely be based primarily on creating trust. Person-centered approaches will be used in which the therapist attempts to create a therapeutic alliance conducive to a frank and open exchange of information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p08">If the therapist is trained in a psychodynamic approach, he or she will probably begin intensive face-to-face psychotherapy sessions at least three times a week. The therapist may focus on childhood experiences related to Bethany’s attachment difficulties but will also focus in large part on the causes of the present behavior. The therapist will understand that because Bethany does not have good relationships with other people, she will likely seek a close bond with the therapist, but the therapist will probably not allow the transference relationship to develop fully. The therapist will also realize that Bethany will probably try to resist the work of the therapist.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p09">Most likely the therapist will also use principles of CBT. For one, cognitive therapy will likely be used in an attempt to change Bethany’s distortions of reality. She feels that people are rejecting her, but she is probably bringing these rejections on herself. If she can learn to better understand the meaning of other people’s actions, she may feel better. And the therapist will likely begin using some techniques of behavior therapy, for instance, by rewarding Bethany for successful social interactions and progress toward meeting her important goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p10">The eclectic therapist will continue to monitor Bethany’s behavior as the therapy continues, bringing into play whatever therapeutic tools seem most beneficial. Hopefully, Bethany will stay in treatment long enough to make some real progress in repairing her broken life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s01_s04_p11">One example of an eclectic treatment approach that has been shown to be successful in treating BPD is <em class="emphasis">dialectical behavioral therapy</em> (DBT; Linehan &amp; Dimeff, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_025">Linehan, M. M., &amp; Dimeff, L. (2001). Dialectical behavior therapy in a nutshell. <em class="emphasis">The California Psychologist, 34</em>, 10–13.</span> DBT is essentially a cognitive therapy, but it includes a particular emphasis on attempting to enlist the help of the patient in his or her own treatment. A dialectical behavioral therapist begins by attempting to develop a positive therapeutic alliance with the client, and then tries to encourage the patient to become part of the treament process. In DBT the therapist aims to accept and validate the client’s feelings at any given time while nonetheless informing the client that some feelings and behaviors are maladaptive, and showing the client better alternatives. The therapist will use both individual and group therapy, helping the patient work toward improving interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_p01">Psychologists understand that an appropriate balance of neurotransmitters in the brain is necessary for mental health. If there is a proper balance of chemicals, then the person’s mental health will be acceptable, but psychological disorder will result if there is a chemical imbalance. The most frequently used biological treatments provide the patient with medication that influences the production and reuptake of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS). The use of these drugs is rapidly increasing, and drug therapy is now the most common approach to treatment of most psychological disorders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Unlike some medical therapies that can be targeted toward specific symptoms, current psychological drug therapies are not so specific; they don’t change particular behaviors or thought processes, and they don’t really solve psychological disorders. However, although they cannot “cure” disorder, drug therapies are nevertheless useful therapeutic approaches, particularly when combined with psychological therapy, in treating a variety of psychological disorders. The best drug combination for the individual patient is usually found through trial and error (Biedermann &amp; Fleischhacker, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_026">Biedermann, F., &amp; Fleischhacker, W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p01">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently treated with biomedical therapy, usually along with cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). The most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD are psychostimulants, including Ritalin, Adderall, and Dexedrine. Short-acting forms of the drugs are taken as pills and last between 4 and 12 hours, but some of the drugs are also available in long-acting forms (skin patches) that can be worn on the hip and last up to 12 hours. The patch is placed on the child early in the morning and worn all day.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p02">Stimulants improve the major symptoms of ADHD, including inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, often dramatically, in about 75% of the children who take them (Greenhill, Halperin, &amp; Abikof, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_027">Greenhill, L. L., Halperin, J. M., &amp; Abikof, H. (1999). Stimulant medications. <em class="emphasis">Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 38</em>(5), 503–512.</span> But the effects of the drugs wear off quickly. Additionally, the best drug and best dosage varies from child to child, so it may take some time to find the correct combination.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p03">It may seem surprising to you that a disorder that involves hyperactivity is treated with a psychostimulant, a drug that normally increases activity. The answer lies in the dosage. When large doses of stimulants are taken, they increase activity, but in smaller doses the same stimulants improve attention and decrease motor activity (Zahn, Rapoport, &amp; Thompson, 1980).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_028">Zahn, T.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p04">The most common side effects of psychostimulants in children include decreased appetite, weight loss, sleeping problems, and irritability as the effect of the medication tapers off. Stimulant medications may also be associated with a slightly reduced growth rate in children, although in most cases growth isn’t permanently affected (Spencer, Biederman, Harding, &amp; O’Donnell, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_029">Spencer, T.

Although they are used primarily in the treatment of depression, they are also effective for patients who suffer from anxiety, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Antidepressants work by influencing the production and reuptake of neurotransmitters that relate to emotion, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Although exactly why they work is not yet known, as the amount of the neurotransmitters in the CNS is increased through the action of the drugs, the person often experiences less depression.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p02">The original antidepressants were the <em class="emphasis">tricyclic antidepressants</em>, with the brand names of Tofranil and Elavil, and the <em class="emphasis">monamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)</em>. These medications work by increasing the amount of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine at the synapses, but they also have severe side effects including potential increases in blood pressure and the need to follow particular diets.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p03">The antidepressants most prescribed today are the <em class="emphasis">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</em> (<em class="emphasis">SSRIs</em>), including Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft, which are designed to selectively block the reuptake of serotonin at the synapse, thereby leaving more serotonin available in the CNS. SSRIs are safer and have fewer side effects than the tricyclics or the MAOIs (Fraser, 2000; Hollon, Thase, &amp; Markowitz, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_030">Fraser, A. R.

Treatment and prevention of depression. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 3</em>, 39–77.</span> SSRIs are effective, but patients taking them often suffer a variety of sometimes unpleasant side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, headache, agitation, drowsiness, as well as a reduction in sexual enjoyment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p04">Recently, there has been concern that SSRIs may increase the risk of suicide among teens and young adults, probably because when the medications begin working they give patients more energy, which may lead them to commit the suicide that they had been planning but lacked the energy to go through with. This concern has led the FDA to put a warning label on SSRI medications and has led doctors to be more selective about prescribing antidepressants to this age group (Healy &amp; Whitaker, 2003; Simon, 2006; Simon, Savarino, Operskalski, &amp; Wang, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_031">Healy, D., &amp; Whitaker, C.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p05">Because the effects of antidepressants may take weeks or even months to develop, doctors usually work with each patient to determine which medications are most effective, and may frequently change medications over the course of therapy. In some cases other types of antidepressants may be used instead of or in addition to the SSRIs. These medications also work by blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Brand names of these medications include Effexor and Wellbutrin.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p06">Patients who are suffering from bipolar disorder are not helped by the SSRIs or other antidepressants because their disorder also involves the experience of overly positive moods. Treatment is more complicated for these patients, often involving a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants along with <em class="emphasis">mood stabilizing medications</em> (McElroy &amp; Keck, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_032">McElroy, S. L., &amp; Keck, P. E. (2000). Pharmacologic agents for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. <em class="emphasis">Biological Psychiatry, 48</em>, 539–557.</span> The most well-known mood stabilizer, lithium carbonate (or “lithium”), was approved by the FDA in the 1970s for treating both manic and depressive episodes, and it has proven very effective. Anticonvulsant medications can also be used as mood stabilizers. Another drug, Depakote, has also proven very effective, and some bipolar patients may do better with it than with lithium (Kowatch et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_033">Kowatch, R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p07">People who take lithium must have regular blood tests to be sure that the levels of the drug are in the appropriate range. Potential negative side effects of lithium are loss of coordination, slurred speech, frequent urination, and excessive thirst. Though side effects often cause patients to stop taking their medication, it is important that treatment be continuous, rather than intermittent. There is no cure for bipolar disorder, but drug therapy does help many people.</p>

These drugs, which are prescribed millions of times a year, include Ativan, Valium, and Xanax.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p01">Until the middle of the 20th century, schizophrenia was inevitably accompanied by the presence of positive symptoms, including bizarre, disruptive, and potentially dangerous behavior. As a result, schizophrenics were locked in asylums to protect them from themselves and to protect society from them. In the 1950s, a drug called chlorpromazine (Thorazine) was discovered that could reduce many of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Chlorpromazine was the first of many <em class="emphasis">antipsychotic drugs</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics)</a><span class="glossdef">Drugs that treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and related disorders.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">drugs that treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders</em>. Today there are many antipsychotics, including Thorazine, Haldol, Clozaril, Risperdal, and Zyprexa. Some of these drugs treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and some treat both the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p03">The discovery of chlorpromazine and its use in clinics has been described as the single greatest advance in psychiatric care, because it has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients in psychiatric hospitals worldwide. Using antipsychotic medications has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to move out of asylums into individual households or community mental health centers, and in many cases to live near-normal lives.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p04">Antipsychotics reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia by reducing the transmission of dopamine at the synapses in the limbic system, and they improve negative symptoms by influencing levels of serotonin (Marangell, Silver, Goff, &amp; Yudofsky, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_035">Marangell, L.

ECT has been used since the 1930s to treat severe depression.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p02">When it was first developed, the procedure involved strapping the patient to a table before the electricity was administered. The patient was knocked out by the shock, went into severe convulsions, and awoke later, usually without any memory of what had happened. Today ECT is used only in the most severe cases when all other treatments have failed, and the practice is more humane. The patient is first given muscle relaxants and a general anesthesia, and precisely calculated electrical currents are used to achieve the most benefit with the fewest possible risks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s02_s02_p03">ECT is very effective; about 80% of people who undergo three sessions of ECT report dramatic relief from their depression.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_p01">Although the individual therapies that we have discussed so far in this chapter focus primarily on the psychological and biological aspects of the bio-psycho-social model of disorder, the social dimension is never out of the picture. Therapists understand that disorder is caused, and potentially prevented, in large part by the people with whom we interact. A person with schizophrenia does not live in a vacuum. He interacts with his family members and with the other members of the community, and the behavior of those people may influence his disease. And depression and anxiety are created primarily by the affected individual’s perceptions (and misperceptions) of the important people around them. Thus prevention and treatment are influenced in large part by the social context in which the person is living.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Group, Couples, and Family Therapy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s01_p01">Practitioners sometimes incorporate the social setting in which disorder occurs by conducting therapy in groups. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Group therapy</a><span class="glossdef">Psychotherapy in which clients receive psychological treatment together with others.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">psychotherapy in which clients receive psychological treatment together with others</em>. A professionally trained therapist guides the group, usually between 6 and 10 participants, to create an atmosphere of support and emotional safety for the participants (Yalom &amp; Leszcz, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_046">Yalom, I., &amp; Leszcz, M. (2005). <em class="emphasis">The theory and practice of group psychotherapy</em> (5th ed.). New York, NY: Basic Books.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s01_p02">Group therapy provides a safe place where people come together to share problems or concerns, to better understand their own situations, and to learn from and with each other. Group therapy is often cheaper than individual therapy, as the therapist can treat more people at the same time, but economy is only one part of its attraction. Group therapy allows people to help each other, by sharing ideas, problems, and solutions. It provides social support, offers the knowledge that other people are facing and successfully coping with similar situations, and allows group members to model the successful behaviors of other group members. Group therapy makes explicit the idea that our interactions with others may create, intensify, and potentially alleviate disorders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s01_p03">Group therapy has met with much success in the more than 50 years it has been in use, and it has generally been found to be as or more effective than individual therapy (McDermut, Miller, &amp; Brown, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_047">McDermut, W., Miller, I. W., &amp; Brown, R. A. (2001). The efficacy of group psychotherapy for depression: A meta-analysis and review of the empirical research<em class="emphasis">. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 8</em>(1), 98–116.</span> Group therapy is particularly effective for people who have life-altering illness, as it helps them cope better with their disease, enhances the quality of their lives, and in some cases has even been shown to help them live longer (American Group Psychotherapy Association, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_048">American Group Psychotherapy Association.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s01_p04">Sometimes group therapy is conducted with people who are in close relationships. <em class="emphasis">Couples therapy</em> is treatment in which two people who are cohabitating, married, or dating meet together with the practitioner to discuss their concerns and issues about their relationship. These therapies are in some cases educational, providing the couple with information about what is to be expected in a relationship. The therapy may focus on such topics as sexual enjoyment, communication, or the symptoms of one of the partners (e.g., depression).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s01_p05"><em class="emphasis">Family therapy</em> involves families meeting together with a therapist. In some cases the meeting is precipitated by a particular problem with one family member, such as a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in a child. Family therapy is based on the assumption that the problem, even if it is primarily affecting one person, is the result of an interaction among the people in the family.</p>

    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Self-Help Groups</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s02_p01">Group therapy is based on the idea that people can be helped by the positive social relationships that others provide. One way for people to gain this social support is by joining a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-help group</a><span class="glossdef">A voluntary association of people who share a common desire to overcome psychological disorder or improve their well-being.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">a voluntary association of people who share a common desire to overcome psychological disorder or improve their well-being</em> (Humphreys &amp; Rappaport, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_049">Humphreys, K., &amp; Rappaport, J. (1994). Researching self-help/mutual aid groups and organizations: Many roads, one journey. <em class="emphasis">Applied and Preventative Psychology, 3</em>(4), 217–231.</span> Self-help groups have been used to help individuals cope with many types of addictive behaviors. Three of the best-known self-help groups are Alcoholics Anonymous, of which there are more than two million members in the United States, Gamblers Anonymous, and Overeaters Anonymous.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s02_p02">The idea behind self-groups is very similar to that of group therapy, but the groups are open to a broader spectrum of people. As in group therapy, the benefits include social support, education, and observational learning. Religion and spirituality are often emphasized, and self-blame is discouraged. Regular group meetings are held with the supervision of a trained leader.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s03_p09">Secondary prevention focuses on people who are at risk for disorder or for harmful behaviors. Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and prevention efforts can help people consider other alternatives, particularly if it can be determined who is most at risk. Determining whether a person is at risk of suicide is difficult, however, because people are motivated to deny or conceal such thoughts to avoid intervention or hospitalization. One recent study found that 78% of patients who die by suicide explicitly deny suicidal thoughts in their last verbal communications before killing themselves (Busch, Fawcett, &amp; Jacobs, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_053">Busch, K. A., Fawcett, J., &amp; Jacobs, D. G. (2003). Clinical correlates of inpatient suicide. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 64</em>(1), 14–19.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s03_p10">Nock et al. (2010)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_054">Nock, M. K., Park, J. M., Finn, C. T., Deliberto, T. L., Dour, H. J., &amp; Banaji, M. R. (2010). Measuring the suicidal mind: Implicit cognition predicts suicidal behavior. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 21</em>(4), 511–517.</span> tested the possibility that implicit measures of the association between the self-concept and death might provide a more direct behavioral marker of suicide risk that would allow professionals to more accurately determine whether a person is likely to commit suicide in comparison to existing self-report measures. They measured implicit associations about death and suicide in 157 people seeking treatment at a psychiatric emergency department.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s03_p11">The participants all completed a version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which was designed to assess the strength of a person’s mental associations between death and the self (Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_055">Greenwald, A.

Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: The Implicit Association Test. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74</em>, 1464–1480.</span> Using a notebook computer, participants classified stimuli representing the constructs of “death” (i.e., die, dead, deceased, lifeless, and suicide) and “life” (i.e., alive, survive, live, thrive, and breathing) and the attributes of “me” (i.e., I, myself, my, mine, and self) and “not me” (i.e., they, them, their, theirs, and other). Response latencies for all trials were recorded and analyzed, and the strength of each participant’s association between “death” and “me” was calculated.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s03_s03_p12">The researchers then followed participants over the next 6 months to test whether the measured implicit association of death with self could be used to predict future suicide attempts. The authors also tested whether scores on the IAT would add to prediction of risk above and beyond other measures of risk, including questionnaire and interview measures of suicide risk. Scores on the IAT predicted suicide attempts in the next 6 months above all the other risk factors that were collected by the hospital staff, including past history of suicide attempts. These results suggest that measures of implicit cognition may be useful for determining risk factors for clinical behaviors such as suicide.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_p01">We have seen that psychologists and other practitioners employ a variety of treatments in their attempts to reduce the negative outcomes of psychological disorders. But we have not yet considered the important question of whether these treatments are effective, and if they are, which approaches are most effective for which people and for which disorders. Accurate empirical answers to these questions are important as they help practitioners focus their efforts on the techniques that have been proven to be most promising, and will guide societies as they make decisions about how to spend public money to improve the quality of life of their citizens (Hunsley &amp; Di Giulio, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_056">Hunsley, J., &amp; Di Giulio, G.

The question of psychotherapy equivalence. <em class="emphasis">The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice: Objective Investigations of Controversial and Unorthodox Claims in Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, and Social Work, 1</em>(1), 11–22.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_p02">Psychologists use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">outcome research</a><span class="glossdef">Studies that assess the effectiveness of medical treatments.</span></span>, that is, <em class="emphasis">studies that assess the effectiveness of medical treatments</em>, to determine the effectiveness of different therapies. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch13_s04_f01">Figure 13.10 "Outcome Research"</a>, in these studies the independent variable is the type of the treatment—for instance, whether it was psychological or biological in orientation or how long it lasted. In most cases characteristics of the client (e.g., his or her gender, age, disease severity, and prior psychological histories) are also collected as control variables. The dependent measure is an assessment of the benefit received by the client. In some cases we might simply ask the client if she feels better, and in other cases we may directly measure behavior: Can the client now get in the airplane and take a flight? Has the client remained out of juvenile detention?</p>

        <p class="para">The design of an outcome study includes a dependent measure of benefit received by the client, as predicted by independent variables including type of treatment and characteristics of the individual.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_p03">In every case the scientists evaluating the therapy must keep in mind the potential that other effects rather than the treatment itself might be important, that some treatments that seem effective might not be, and that some treatments might actually be harmful, at least in the sense that money and time are spent on programs or drugs that do not work.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_p04">One threat to the validity of outcome research studies is <em class="emphasis">natural improvement</em>—the possibility that people might get better over time, even without treatment. People who begin therapy or join a self-help group do so because they are feeling bad or engaging in unhealthy behaviors. After being in a program over a period of time, people frequently feel that they are getting better. But it is possible that they would have improved even if they had not attended the program, and that the program is not actually making a difference. To demonstrate that the treatment is effective, the people who participate in it must be compared with another group of people who do not get treatment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_p05">Another possibility is that therapy works, but that it doesn’t really matter which type of therapy it is. <em class="emphasis">Nonspecific treatment effects</em> occur when the patient gets better over time simply by coming to therapy, even though it doesn’t matter what actually happens at the therapy sessions. The idea is that therapy works, in the sense that it is better than doing nothing, but that all therapies are pretty much equal in what they are able to accomplish. Finally, <em class="emphasis">placebo effects</em> are improvements that occur as a result of the expectation that one will get better rather than from the actual effects of a treatment.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Effectiveness of Psychological Therapy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s01_p01">Thousands of studies have been conducted to test the effectiveness of psychotherapy, and by and large they find evidence that it works. Some outcome studies compare a group that gets treatment with another (control) group that gets no treatment. For instance, Ruwaard, Broeksteeg, Schrieken, Emmelkamp, and Lange (2010)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_057">Ruwaard, J., Broeksteeg, J., Schrieken, B., Emmelkamp, P., &amp; Lange, A. (2010). Web-based therapist-assisted cognitive behavioral treatment of panic symptoms: A randomized controlled trial with a three-year follow-up. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 24</em>(4), 387–396.</span> found that patients who interacted with a therapist over a website showed more reduction in symptoms of panic disorder than did a similar group of patients who were on a waiting list but did not get therapy. Although studies such as this one control for the possibility of natural improvement (the treatment group improved more than the control group, which would not have happened if both groups had only been improving naturally over time), they do not control for either nonspecific treatment effects or for placebo effects. The people in the treatment group might have improved simply by being in the therapy (nonspecific effects), or they may have improved because they expected the treatment to help them (placebo effects).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s01_p02">An alternative is to compare a group that gets “real” therapy with a group that gets only a placebo. For instance, Keller et al. (2001)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_058">Keller, M. B., Ryan, N. D., Strober, M., Klein, R. G., Kutcher, S. P., Birmaher, B.,…McCafferty, J. P. (2001). Efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of adolescent major depression: A randomized, controlled trial. <em class="emphasis">Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 40</em>(7), 762–772.</span> had adolescents who were experiencing anxiety disorders take pills that they thought would reduce anxiety for 8 weeks. However, one-half of the patients were randomly assigned to actually receive the antianxiety drug Paxil, while the other half received a placebo drug that did not have any medical properties. The researchers ruled out the possibility that only placebo effects were occurring because they found that both groups improved over the 8 weeks, but the group that received Paxil improved significantly more than the placebo group did.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s01_p03">Studies that use a control group that gets no treatment or a group that gets only a placebo are informative, but they also raise ethical questions. If the researchers believe that their treatment is going to work, why would they deprive some of their participants, who are in need of help, of the possibility for improvement by putting them in a control group?</p>

            <h3 class="title">Research Focus: Meta-Analyzing Clinical Outcomes</h3>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s01_p06">Because there are thousands of studies testing the effectiveness of psychotherapy, and the independent and dependent variables in the studies vary widely, the results are often combined using a <em class="emphasis">meta-analysis</em>.

In one important meta-analysis analyzing the effect of psychotherapy, Smith, Glass, and Miller (1980)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_062">Smith, M. L., Glass, G. V., &amp; Miller, R. L. (1980). The benefits of psychotherapy. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.</span> summarized studies that compared different types of therapy or that compared the effectiveness of therapy against a control group. To find the studies, the researchers systematically searched computer databases and the reference sections of previous research reports to locate every study that met the inclusion criteria. Over 475 studies were located, and these studies used over 10,000 research participants.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s01_p07">The results of each of these studies were systematically coded, and a measure of the effectiveness of treatment known as the <em class="emphasis">effect size</em> was created for each study. Smith and her colleagues found that the average effect size for the influence of therapy was 0.85, indicating that psychotherapy had a relatively large positive effect on recovery. What this means is that, overall, receiving psychotherapy for behavioral problems is substantially better for the individual than not receiving therapy (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch13_s04_s01_f02">Figure 13.12 "Normal Curves of Those Who Do and Do Not Get Treatment"</a>). Although they did not measure it, psychotherapy presumably has large societal benefits as well—the cost of the therapy is likely more than made up for by the increased productivity of those who receive it.</p>

This is true partly because there are fewer distinctions among the ways that different therapies are practiced than the theoretical differences among them would suggest. What a good therapist practicing psychodynamic approaches does in therapy is often not much different from what a humanist or a cognitive-behavioral therapist does, and so no one approach is really likely to be better than the other.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s01_p10">What all good therapies have in common is that they give people hope; help them think more carefully about themselves and about their relationships with others; and provide a positive, empathic, and trusting relationship with the therapist—the therapeutic alliance (Ahn &amp; Wampold, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_069">Ahn, H.-N., &amp; Wampold, B.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Effectiveness of Biomedical Therapies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s02_p01">Although there are fewer of them because fewer studies have been conducted, meta-analyses also support the effectiveness of drug therapies for psychological disorder. For instance, the use of psychostimulants to reduce the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well known to be successful, and many studies find that the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are substantially reduced by the use of antipsychotic medications (Lieberman et al., 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_070">Lieberman, J., Stroup, T., McEvoy, J., Swartz, M., Rosenheck, R., Perkins, D.,…Lebowitz, B.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s02_p02">People who take antidepressants for mood disorders or antianxiety medications for anxiety disorders almost always report feeling better, although drugs are less helpful for phobic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some of these improvements are almost certainly the result of placebo effects (Cardeña &amp; Kirsch, 2000),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_071">Cardeña, E., &amp; Kirsch, I. (2000).

An analysis of U.S. Food and Drug Administration databases found effect sizes of 0.26 for Prozac, 0.26 for Zoloft, 0.24 for Celexa, 0.31 for Lexapro, and 0.30 for Cymbalta. The overall average effect size for antidepressant medications approved by the FDA between 1987 and 2004 was 0.31 (Deshauer et al., 2008; Turner, Matthews, Linardatos, Tell, &amp; Rosenthal, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn13_072">Deshauer, D., Moher, D., Fergusson, D., Moher, E., Sampson, M., &amp; Grimshaw, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s02_p03">One problem with drug therapies is that although they provide temporary relief, they don’t treat the underlying cause of the disorder. Once the patient stops taking the drug, the symptoms often return in full force. In addition many drugs have negative side effects, and some also have the potential for addiction and abuse. Different people have different reactions, and all drugs carry warning labels. As a result, although these drugs are frequently prescribed, doctors attempt to prescribe the lowest doses possible for the shortest possible periods of time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s02_p04">Older patients face special difficulties when they take medications for mental illness. Older people are more sensitive to drugs, and drug interactions are more likely because older patients tend to take a variety of different drugs every day. They are more likely to forget to take their pills, to take too many or too few, or to mix them up due to poor eyesight or faulty memory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s04_s02_p05">Like all types of drugs, medications used in the treatment of mental illnesses can carry risks to an unborn infant. Tranquilizers should not be taken by women who are pregnant or expecting to become pregnant, because they may cause birth defects or other infant problems, especially if taken during the first trimester.

<span class="title-prefix">13.5</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p01">Psychological disorders create a tremendous individual, social, and economic drain on society. Psychologists work to reduce this burden by preventing and treating disorder. Psychologists base this treatment and prevention of disorder on the bio-psycho-social model, which proposes that disorder has biological, psychological, and social causes, and that each of these aspects can be the focus of reducing disorder.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p02">Treatment for psychological disorder begins with a formal psychological assessment. In addition to the psychological assessment, the patient is usually seen by a physician to gain information about potential Axis III (physical) problems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p03">One approach to treatment is psychotherapy. The fundamental aspect of psychotherapy is that the patient directly confronts the disorder and works with the therapist to help reduce it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p04">Psychodynamic therapy (also known as psychoanalysis) is a psychological treatment based on Freudian and neo-Freudian personality theories. The analyst engages with the patient in one-on-one sessions during which the patient verbalizes his or her thoughts through free associations and by reporting on his or her dreams. The goal of the therapy is to help the patient develop insight—that is, an understanding of the unconscious causes of the disorder.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p05">Humanistic therapy is a psychological treatment based on the personality theories of Carl Rogers and other humanistic psychologists. Humanistic therapies attempt to promote growth and responsibility by helping clients consider their own situations and the world around them and how they can work to achieve their life goals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p06">The humanistic therapy promotes the ideas of genuineness, empathy, and unconditional positive regard in a nurturing relationship in which the therapist actively listens to and reflects the feelings of the client; this relationship is probably the most fundamental part of contemporary psychotherapy</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p07">Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is a structured approach to treatment that attempts to reduce psychological disorders through systematic procedures based on cognitive and behavioral principles. CBT is a very broad approach used for the treatment of a variety of problems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p08">Behavioral aspects of CBT may include operant conditioning using reward or punishment. When the disorder is anxiety or phobia, then the goal of the CBT is to reduce the negative affective responses to the feared stimulus through exposure therapy, flooding, or systematic desensitization. Aversion therapy is a type of behavior therapy in which positive punishment is used to reduce the frequency of an undesirable behavior.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p09">Cognitive aspects of CBT include treatment that helps clients identify incorrect or distorted beliefs that are contributing to disorder.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p10">The most commonly used approaches to therapy are eclectic, such that the therapist uses whichever techniques seem most useful and relevant for a given patient.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p11">Biomedical therapies are treatments designed to reduce psychological disorder by influencing the action of the central nervous system. These therapies primarily involve the use of medications but also include direct methods of brain intervention, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and psychosurgery.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p12">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is treated using low doses of psychostimulants, including Ritalin, Adderall, and Dexedrine.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p13">Mood disorders are most commonly treated with the antidepressant medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft. The SSRIs selectively block the reuptake of serotonin at the synapse. Bipolar disorder is treated with mood stabilizing medications.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p14">Antianxiety medications, including the tranquilizers Ativan, Valium, and Xanax, are used to treat anxiety disorders.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p15">Schizophrenia is treated with antipsychotic drugs, including Thorazine, Haldol, Clozaril, Risperdal, and Zyprexa. Some of these drugs treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and some treat both the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p16">Practitioners frequently incorporate the social setting in which disorder occurs by conducting therapy in groups, with couples, or with families. One way for people to gain this social support is by joining a self-help group.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p17">Community mental health services refer to psychological treatments and interventions that are distributed at the community level. These centers provide primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p18">Psychologists use outcome research to determine the effectiveness of different therapies. These studies help determine if improvement is due to natural improvement, nonspecific treatment effects, or placebo effects. Research finds that psychotherapy and biomedical therapies are both effective in treating disorder, but there is not much evidence that any one type of therapy is more effective than any other type. What all good therapies have in common is that they give people hope; help them think more carefully about themselves and about their relationships with others; and provide a positive, empathic, and trusting relationship with the therapist—the therapeutic alliance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p19">One problem with drug therapies is that although they provide temporary relief, they don’t treat the underlying cause of the disorder. Once the patient stops taking the drug, the symptoms often return in full force.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch13_s05_p20">Data suggest that although some community prevention programs are successful, the changes brought about by even the best of these programs are, on average, modest.</p>
