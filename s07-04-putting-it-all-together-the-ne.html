    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_p01">Now that we have considered how individual neurons operate and the roles of the different brain areas, it is time to ask how the body manages to “put it all together.” How do the complex activities in the various parts of the brain, the simple all-or-nothing firings of billions of interconnected neurons, and the various chemical systems within the body, work together to allow the body to respond to the social environment and engage in everyday behaviors? In this section we will see that the complexities of human behavior are accomplished through the joint actions of electrical and chemical processes in the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p01">The nervous system (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s04_s01_f01">Figure 3.17 "The Functional Divisions of the Nervous System"</a>), the electrical information highway of the body, is made up of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nerves</a><span class="glossdef">A bundle of interconnected neurons that fires in synchrony to carry messages.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">bundles of interconnected neurons that fire in synchrony to carry messages</em>. The <em class="emphasis">central nervous system (CNS)</em>, made up of the brain and spinal cord, is the major controller of the body’s functions, charged with interpreting sensory information and responding to it with its own directives. The CNS interprets information coming in from the senses, formulates an appropriate reaction, and sends responses to the appropriate system to respond accordingly. Everything that we see, hear, smell, touch, and taste is conveyed to us from our sensory organs as neural impulses, and each of the commands that the brain sends to the body, both consciously and unconsciously, travels through this system as well.</p>

It is the central throughway of information for the body. Within the spinal cord, ascending tracts of sensory neurons relay sensory information from the sense organs to the brain while descending tracts of motor neurons relay motor commands back to the body.

When you touch a hot stove and immediately pull your hand back, or when you fumble your cell phone and instinctively reach to catch it before it falls, reflexes in your spinal cord order the appropriate responses before your brain even knows what is happening.</p>

            <p class="para">The central nervous system can interpret signals from sensory neurons and respond to them extremely quickly via the motor neurons without any need for the brain to be involved. These quick responses, known as reflexes, can reduce the damage that we might experience as a result of, for instance, touching a hot stove.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p04">If the central nervous system is the command center of the body, the <em class="emphasis">peripheral nervous system (PNS)</em> represents the front line. The PNS links the CNS to the body’s sense receptors, muscles, and glands. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s04_s01_f03">Figure 3.19 "The Autonomic Nervous System"</a>, the peripheral nervous system is itself divided into two subsystems, one controlling internal responses and one controlling external responses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p05">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">autonomic nervous system (ANS)</a><span class="glossdef">The division of the PNS that governs the internal activities of the human body, including heart rate, breathing, digestion, salivation, perspiration, urination, and sexual arousal.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the division of the PNS that governs the internal activities of the human body, including heart rate, breathing, digestion, salivation, perspiration, urination, and sexual arousal</em>. Many of the actions of the ANS, such as heart rate and digestion, are automatic and out of our conscious control, but others, such as breathing and sexual activity, can be controlled and influenced by conscious processes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p06">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">somatic nervous system (SNS)</a><span class="glossdef">The division of the PNS that controls the external aspects of the body, including the skeletal muscles, skin, and sense organs.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the division of the PNS that controls the external aspects of the body</em>, including the skeletal muscles, skin, and sense organs. The somatic nervous system consists primarily of motor nerves responsible for sending brain signals for muscle contraction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p07">The autonomic nervous system itself can be further subdivided into the <em class="emphasis">sympathetic</em> and <em class="emphasis">parasympathetic</em> systems (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s04_s01_f03">Figure 3.19 "The Autonomic Nervous System"</a>).

The sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions normally function in opposition to each other, such that the sympathetic division acts a bit like the accelerator pedal on a car and the parasympathetic division acts like the brake.</p>

            <p class="para">The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: The sympathetic division acts to energize the body, preparing it for action. The parasympathetic division acts to calm the body, allowing it to rest.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s01_p08">Our everyday activities are controlled by the interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. For example, when we get out of bed in the morning, we would experience a sharp drop in blood pressure if it were not for the action of the sympathetic system, which automatically increases blood flow through the body. Similarly, after we eat a big meal, the parasympathetic system automatically sends more blood to the stomach and intestines, allowing us to efficiently digest the food. And perhaps you’ve had the experience of not being at all hungry before a stressful event, such as a sports game or an exam (when the sympathetic division was primarily in action), but suddenly finding yourself starved afterward, as the parasympathetic takes over. The two systems work together to maintain vital bodily functions, resulting in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">homeostasis</a><span class="glossdef">The natural balance in the body’s systems.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the natural balance in the body’s systems</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p01">The nervous system is designed to protect us from danger through its interpretation of and reactions to stimuli. But a primary function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is to interact with the <em class="emphasis">endocrine system</em> to elicit chemicals that provide another system for influencing our feelings and behaviors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p02">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gland</a><span class="glossdef">A groups of cells that functions to secrete hormones.</span></span> in the endocrine system is made up of <em class="emphasis">groups of cells that function to secrete hormones</em>.

When the hormones released by one gland arrive at receptor tissues or other glands, these receiving receptors may trigger the release of other hormones, resulting in a series of complex chemical chain reactions. The endocrine system works together with the nervous system to influence many aspects of human behavior, including growth, reproduction, and metabolism. And the endocrine system plays a vital role in emotions. Because the glands in men and women differ, hormones also help explain some of the observed behavioral differences between men and women. The major glands in the endocrine system are shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch03_s04_s02_f01">Figure 3.20 "The Major Glands of the Endocrine System"</a>.</p>

The pituitary secretes hormones that influence our responses to pain as well as hormones that signal the ovaries and testes to make sex hormones. The pituitary gland also controls ovulation and the menstrual cycle in women. Because the pituitary has such an important influence on other glands, it is sometimes known as the “master gland.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p04">Other glands in the endocrine system include the <em class="emphasis">pancreas</em>, which secretes hormones designed to keep the body supplied with fuel to produce and maintain stores of energy; the <em class="emphasis">pineal gland</em>, located in the middle of the brain, which secretes melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the wake-sleep cycle; and the <em class="emphasis">thyroid</em> and <em class="emphasis">parathyroid glands</em>, which are responsible for determining how quickly the body uses energy and hormones, and controlling the amount of calcium in the blood and bones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p05">The body has two triangular <em class="emphasis">adrenal glands</em>, one atop each kidney.

The most important function of the adrenal glands is to secrete the hormones <em class="emphasis">epinephrine</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">adrenaline</em>) and <em class="emphasis">norepinephrine</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">noradrenaline</em>) when we are excited, threatened, or stressed. Epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulate the sympathetic division of the ANS, causing increased heart and lung activity, dilation of the pupils, and increases in blood sugar, which give the body a surge of energy to respond to a threat. The activity and role of the adrenal glands in response to stress provides an excellent example of the close relationship and interdependency of the nervous and endocrine systems. A quick-acting nervous system is essential for immediate activation of the adrenal glands, while the endocrine system mobilizes the body for action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p06"><em class="emphasis">The male sex glands</em>, known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">testes</a><span class="glossdef">The male sex glands.</span></span>, secrete a number of hormones, the most important of which is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">testosterone</a><span class="glossdef">The male sex hormone.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the male sex hormone</em>. Testosterone regulates body changes associated with sexual development, including enlargement of the penis, deepening of the voice, growth of facial and pubic hair, and the increase in muscle growth and strength. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ovaries</a><span class="glossdef">The female sex glands.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the female sex glands</em>, are located in the pelvis. They produce eggs and secrete the female hormones <em class="emphasis">estrogen</em> and <em class="emphasis">progesterone</em>. Estrogen is involved in the development of female sexual features, including breast growth, the accumulation of body fat around the hips and thighs, and the growth spurt that occurs during puberty. Both estrogen and progesterone are also involved in pregnancy and the regulation of the menstrual cycle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p07">Recent research has pinpointed some of the important roles of the sex hormones in social behavior. Dabbs, Hargrove, and Heusel (1996)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_051">Dabbs, J. M., Jr., Hargrove, M. F., &amp; Heusel, C. (1996). Testosterone differences among college fraternities: Well-behaved vs. rambunctious. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Individual Differences, 20</em>(2), 157–161.</span> measured the testosterone levels of 240 men who were members of 12 fraternities at two universities. They also obtained descriptions of the fraternities from university officials, fraternity officers, yearbook and chapter house photographs, and researcher field notes. The researchers correlated the testosterone levels and the descriptions of each fraternity. They found that the fraternities with the highest average testosterone levels were also more wild and unruly, and one of these fraternities was known across campus for the crudeness of its behavior. On the other hand, the fraternities with the lowest average testosterone levels were more well behaved, friendly and pleasant, academically successful, and socially responsible. Banks and Dabbs (1996)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_052">Banks, T., &amp; Dabbs, J. M., Jr. (1996). Salivary testosterone and cortisol in delinquent and violent urban subculture. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social Psychology, 136</em>(1), 49–56.</span> found that juvenile delinquents and prisoners who had high levels of testosterone also acted more violently, and Tremblay et al. (1998) <span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_053">Tremblay, R. E., Schaal, B., Boulerice, B., Arseneault, L., Soussignan, R. G., Paquette, D., &amp; Laurent, D. (1998). Testosterone, physical aggression, dominance, and physical development in early adolescence. <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Behavioral Development, 22</em>(4), 753–777.</span> found that testosterone was related to toughness and leadership behaviors in adolescent boys. Although testosterone levels are higher in men than in women, the relationship between testosterone and aggression is not limited to males. Studies have also shown a positive relationship between testosterone and aggression and related behaviors (such as competitiveness) in women (Cashdan, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_054">Cashdan, E. (2003). Hormones and competitive aggression in women. <em class="emphasis">Aggressive Behavior, 29</em>(2), 107–115.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p08">It must be kept in mind that the observed relationships between testosterone levels and aggressive behavior that have been found in these studies do not prove that testosterone causes aggression—the relationships are only correlational. In fact, there is evidence that the relationship between violence and testosterone also goes in the other direction: Playing an aggressive game, such as tennis or even chess, increases the testosterone levels of the winners and decreases the testosterone levels of losers (Gladue, Boechler, &amp; McCaul, 1989; Mazur, Booth, &amp; Dabbs, 1992),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_055">Gladue, B. A., Boechler, M., &amp; McCaul, K. D. (1989). Hormonal response to competition in human males. <em class="emphasis">Aggressive Behavior, 15</em>(6), 409–422; Mazur, A., Booth, A., &amp; Dabbs, J. M. (1992). Testosterone and chess competition. <em class="emphasis">Social Psychology Quarterly, 55</em>(1), 70–77.</span> and perhaps this is why excited soccer fans sometimes riot when their team wins.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p09">Recent research has also begun to document the role that female sex hormones may play in reactions to others. A study about hormonal influences on social-cognitive functioning (Macrae, Alnwick, Milne, &amp; Schloerscheidt, 2002)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn03_056">Macrae, C. N., Alnwick, K. A., Milne, A. B., &amp; Schloerscheidt, A. M. (2002). Person perception across the menstrual cycle: Hormonal influences on social-cognitive functioning. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 13</em>(6), 532–536.</span> found that women were more easily able to perceive and categorize male faces during the more fertile phases of their menstrual cycles. Although researchers did not directly measure the presence of hormones, it is likely that phase-specific hormonal differences influenced the women’s perceptions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch03_s04_s02_p10">At this point you can begin to see the important role the hormones play in behavior. But the hormones we have reviewed in this section represent only a subset of the many influences that hormones have on our behaviors. In the chapters to come we will consider the important roles that hormones play in many other behaviors, including sleeping, sexual activity, and helping and harming others.</p>
