    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_p01">As we have seen, our memories are not perfect. They fail in part due to our inadequate encoding and storage, and in part due to our inability to accurately retrieve stored information. But memory is also influenced by the setting in which it occurs, by the events that occur to us after we have experienced an event, and by the cognitive processes that we use to help us remember. Although our cognition allows us to attend to, rehearse, and organize information, cognition may also lead to distortions and errors in our judgments and our behaviors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_p02">In this section we consider some of the <em class="emphasis">cognitive biases</em> that are known to influence humans. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive biases</a><span class="glossdef">Errors in memory or judgment that are caused by the inappropriate use of cognitive processes.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">errors in memory or judgment that are caused by the inappropriate use of cognitive processes</em> (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch08_s03_t01">Table 8.3 "Cognitive Processes That Pose Threats to Accuracy"</a>). The study of cognitive biases is important both because it relates to the important psychological theme of accuracy versus inaccuracy in perception, and because being aware of the types of errors that we may make can help us avoid them and therefore improve our decision-making skills.</p>

Perhaps you’ve had the experience of wondering whether you really experienced an event or only dreamed or imagined it. If so, you wouldn’t be alone. Rassin, Merkelbach, and Spaan (2001)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_056">Rassin, E., Merckelbach, H., &amp; Spaan, V. (2001). When dreams become a royal road to confusion: Realistic dreams, dissociation, and fantasy proneness. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 189</em>(7), 478–481.</span> reported that up to 25% of college students reported being confused about real versus dreamed events. Studies suggest that people who are fantasy-prone are more likely to experience source monitoring errors (Winograd, Peluso, &amp; Glover, 1998),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_057">Winograd, E., Peluso, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s01_p02">In other cases we may be sure that we remembered the information from real life but be uncertain about exactly where we heard it. Imagine that you read a news story in a tabloid magazine such as the <em class="emphasis">National Enquirer</em>. Probably you would have discounted the information because you know that its source is unreliable. But what if later you were to remember the story but forget the source of the information? If this happens, you might become convinced that the news story is true because you forget to discount it. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sleeper effect</a><span class="glossdef">Attitude change that occurs over time when we forget the source of information.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">attitude change that occurs over time when we forget the source of information</em> (Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, &amp; Baumgardner, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_059">Pratkanis, A.

Kaavya Viswanathan, the author of the book <em class="emphasis">How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life</em>, was accused of plagiarism when it was revealed that many parts of her book were very similar to passages from other material. Viswanathan argued that she had simply forgotten that she had read the other works, mistakenly assuming she had made up the material herself. And the musician George Harrison claimed that he was unaware that the melody of his song “My Sweet Lord” was almost identical to an earlier song by another composer. The judge in the copyright suit that followed ruled that Harrison didn’t intentionally commit the plagiarism.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Schematic Processing: Distortions Based on Expectations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s02_p01">We have seen that schemas help us remember information by organizing material into coherent representations. However, although schemas can improve our memories, they may also lead to cognitive biases. Using schemas may lead us to falsely remember things that never happened to us and to distort or misremember things that did. For one, schemas lead to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">confirmation bias</a><span class="glossdef">A cognitive bias that results in the tendency to verify and confirm our existing memories rather than to challenge and disconfirm them.</span></span>, which is <em class="emphasis">the tendency to verify and confirm our existing memories rather than to challenge and disconfirm them</em>. The confirmation bias occurs because once we have schemas, they influence how we seek out and interpret new information. The confirmation bias leads us to remember information that fits our schemas better than we remember information that disconfirms them (Stangor &amp; McMillan, 1992),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_060">Stangor, C., &amp; McMillan, D. (1992). Memory for expectancy-congruent and expectancy-incongruent information: A review of the social and social developmental literatures. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 111</em>(1), 42–61.</span> a process that makes our stereotypes very difficult to change. And we ask questions in ways that confirm our schemas (Trope &amp; Thompson, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_061">Trope, Y., &amp; Thompson, E. (1997). Looking for truth in all the wrong places? Asymmetric search of individuating information about stereotyped group members. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73</em>, 229–241.</span> If we think that a person is an extrovert, we might ask her about ways that she likes to have fun, thereby making it more likely that we will confirm our beliefs. In short, once we begin to believe in something—for instance, a stereotype about a group of people—it becomes very difficult to later convince us that these beliefs are not true; the beliefs become self-confirming.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s02_p02">Darley and Gross (1983)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_062">Darley, J. M., &amp; Gross, P. H. (1983). A hypothesis-confirming bias in labeling effects. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44</em>, 20–33.</span> demonstrated how schemas about social class could influence memory. In their research they gave participants a picture and some information about a fourth-grade girl named Hannah. To activate a schema about her social class, Hannah was pictured sitting in front of a nice suburban house for one-half of the participants and pictured in front of an impoverished house in an urban area for the other half. Then the participants watched a video that showed Hannah taking an intelligence test. As the test went on, Hannah got some of the questions right and some of them wrong, but the number of correct and incorrect answers was the same in both conditions. Then the participants were asked to remember how many questions Hannah got right and wrong. Demonstrating that stereotypes had influenced memory, the participants who thought that Hannah had come from an upper-class background remembered that she had gotten more correct answers than those who thought she was from a lower-class background.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s02_p03">Our reliance on schemas can also make it more difficult for us to “think outside the box.” Peter Wason (1960)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_063">Wason, P. (1960). On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task. <em class="emphasis">The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 12</em>(3), 129–140.</span> asked college students to determine the rule that was used to generate the numbers 2-4-6 by asking them to generate possible sequences and then telling them if those numbers followed the rule. The first guess that students made was usually “consecutive ascending even numbers,” and they then asked questions designed to confirm their hypothesis (“Does 102-104-106 fit?” “What about 404-406-408?”). Upon receiving information that those guesses did fit the rule, the students stated that the rule was “consecutive ascending even numbers.” But the students’ use of the confirmation bias led them to ask only about instances that confirmed their hypothesis, and not about those that would disconfirm it. They never bothered to ask whether 1-2-3 or 3-11-200 would fit, and if they had they would have learned that the rule was not “consecutive ascending even numbers,” but simply “any three ascending numbers.” Again, you can see that once we have a schema (in this case a hypothesis), we continually retrieve that schema from memory rather than other relevant ones, leading us to act in ways that tend to confirm our beliefs.</p>

Few of the participants realized that the box could be tacked to the wall and used as a platform to hold the candle. The problem again is that our existing memories are powerful, and they bias the way we think about new information. Because the participants were “fixated” on the box’s normal function of holding thumbtacks, they could not see its alternative use.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s03_p04">In addition to distorting our memories for events that have actually occurred, misinformation may lead us to falsely remember information that never occurred. Loftus and her colleagues asked parents to provide them with descriptions of events that did (e.g., moving to a new house) and did not (e.g., being lost in a shopping mall) happen to their children. Then (without telling the children which events were real or made-up) the researchers asked the children to imagine both types of events. The children were instructed to “think real hard” about whether the events had occurred (Ceci, Huffman, Smith, &amp; Loftus, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_067">Ceci, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s03_p05">The ease with which memories can be created or implanted is particularly problematic when the events to be recalled have important consequences. Therapists often argue that patients may repress memories of traumatic events they experienced as children, such as childhood sexual abuse, and then recover the events years later as the therapist leads them to recall the information—for instance, by using dream interpretation and hypnosis (Brown, Scheflin, &amp; Hammond, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_070">Brown, D., Scheflin, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s03_p06">But other researchers argue that painful memories such as sexual abuse are usually very well remembered, that few memories are actually repressed, and that even if they are it is virtually impossible for patients to accurately retrieve them years later (McNally, Bryant, &amp; Ehlers, 2003; Pope, Poliakoff, Parker, Boynes, &amp; Hudson, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_071">McNally, R.

Because hundreds of people have been accused, and even imprisoned, on the basis of claims about “recovered memory” of child sexual abuse, the accuracy of these memories has important societal implications. Many psychologists now believe that most of these claims of recovered memories are due to implanted, rather than real, memories (Loftus &amp; Ketcham, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_072">Loftus, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s05_p03">Most people think that list B is more likely, probably because list B looks more random, and thus matches (is “representative of”) our ideas about randomness. But statisticians know that any pattern of four girls and four boys is mathematically equally likely. The problem is that we have a schema of what randomness should be like, which doesn’t always match what is mathematically the case. Similarly, people who see a flipped coin come up “heads” five times in a row will frequently predict, and perhaps even wager money, that “tails” will be next. This behavior is known as the <em class="emphasis">gambler’s fallacy</em>. But mathematically, the gambler’s fallacy is an error: The likelihood of any single coin flip being “tails” is always 50%, regardless of how many times it has come up “heads” in the past.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s05_p04">Our judgments can also be influenced by how easy it is to retrieve a memory. <em class="emphasis">The tendency to make judgments of the frequency or likelihood that an event occurs on the basis of the ease with which it can be retrieved from memory</em> is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">availability heuristic</a><span class="glossdef">A cognitive bias that involves the tendency to make judgments of the frequency or likelihood that an event occurs on the basis of the ease with which the event can be retrieved from memory.</span></span> (MacLeod &amp; Campbell, 1992; Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1973).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_078">MacLeod, C., &amp; Campbell, L.

Memory accessibility and probability judgments: An experimental evaluation of the availability heuristic. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63</em>(6), 890–902; Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. (1973). Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability. <em class="emphasis">Cognitive Psychology, 5</em>, 207–232.</span> Imagine, for instance, that I asked you to indicate whether there are more words in the English language that begin with the letter “R” or that have the letter “R” as the third letter. You would probably answer this question by trying to think of words that have each of the characteristics, thinking of all the words you know that begin with “R” and all that have “R” in the third position. Because it is much easier to retrieve words by their first letter than by their third, we may incorrectly guess that there are more words that begin with “R,” even though there are in fact more words that have “R” as the third letter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s05_p05">The availability heuristic may also operate on episodic memory. We may think that our friends are nice people, because we see and remember them primarily when they are around us (their friends, who they are, of course, nice to). And the traffic might seem worse in our own neighborhood than we think it is in other places, in part because nearby traffic jams are more easily retrieved than are traffic jams that occur somewhere else.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Salience and Cognitive Accessibility</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p01">Still another potential for bias in memory occurs because we are more likely to attend to, and thus make use of and remember, some information more than other information. For one, we tend to attend to and remember things that are highly <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">salient</a><span class="glossdef">Attracting attention.</span></span>, meaning that <em class="emphasis">they attract our attention</em>. Things that are unique, colorful, bright, moving, and unexpected are more salient (McArthur &amp; Post, 1977; Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_079">McArthur, L. Z., &amp; Post, D. L. (1977). Figural emphasis and person perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 13</em>(6), 520–535; Taylor, S. E., &amp; Fiske, S. T. (1978).

F., Loftus, G. R., &amp; Messo, J. (1987). Some facts about “weapon focus.” <em class="emphasis">Law and Human Behavior, 11</em>(1), 55–62.</span> showed people images of a customer walking up to a bank teller and pulling out either a pistol or a checkbook. By tracking eye movements, the researchers determined that people were more likely to look at the gun than at the checkbook, and that this reduced their ability to accurately identify the criminal in a lineup that was given later. The salience of the gun drew people’s attention away from the face of the criminal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p02">The salience of the stimuli in our social worlds has a big influence on our judgment, and in some cases may lead us to behave in ways that we might better not have. Imagine, for instance, that you wanted to buy a new music player for yourself. You’ve been trying to decide whether to get the iPod or the Zune. You checked <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em> online and found that, although the players differed on many dimensions, including price, battery life, ability to share music, and so forth, the Zune was nevertheless rated significantly higher by owners than was the iPod. As a result, you decide to purchase the Zune the next day. That night, however, you go to a party, and a friend shows you her iPod. You check it out, and it seems really cool. You tell her that you were thinking of buying a Zune, and she tells you that you are crazy. She says she knows someone who had one and it had a lot of problems—it didn’t download music correctly, the battery died right after the warranty expired, and so forth—and that she would never buy one. Would you still buy the Zune, or would you switch your plans?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p03">If you think about this question logically, the information that you just got from your friend isn’t really all that important. You now know the opinion of one more person, but that can’t change the overall rating of the two machines very much. On the other hand, the information your friend gives you, and the chance to use her iPod, are highly salient. The information is right there in front of you, in your hand, whereas the statistical information from <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em> is only in the form of a table that you saw on your computer. The outcome in cases such as this is that people frequently ignore the less salient but more important information, such as the likelihood that events occur across a large population (these statistics are known as <em class="emphasis">base rates</em>), in favor of the less important but nevertheless more salient information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s06_p04">People also vary in the schemas that they find important to use when judging others and when thinking about themselves. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive accessibility</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which knowledge is activated in memory, and thus likely to be used in cognition and behavior.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the extent to which knowledge is activated in memory, and thus likely to be used in cognition and behavior</em>. For instance, you probably know a person who is a golf nut (or fanatic of another sport). All he can talk about is golf. For him, we would say that golf is a highly accessible construct. Because he loves golf, it is important to his self-concept, he sets many of his goals in terms of the sport, and he tends to think about things and people in terms of it (“if he plays golf, he must be a good person!”). Other people have highly accessible schemas about environmental issues, eating healthy food, or drinking really good coffee. When schemas are highly accessible, we are likely to use them to make judgments of ourselves and others, and this overuse may inappropriately color our judgments.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p03">Tom Gilovich and his colleagues (Medvec, Madey, &amp; Gilovich, 1995)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_083">Medvec, V. H., Madey, S. F., &amp; Gilovich, T. (1995). When less is more: Counterfactual thinking and satisfaction among Olympic medalists. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 69</em>(4), 603–610.</span> investigated this idea by videotaping the responses of athletes who won medals in the 1992 Summer Olympic Games. They videotaped the athletes both as they learned that they had won a silver or a bronze medal and again as they were awarded the medal. Then the researchers showed these videos, without any sound, to raters who did not know which medal which athlete had won. The raters were asked to indicate how they thought the athlete was feeling, using a range of feelings from “agony” to “ecstasy.” The results showed that the bronze medalists were, on average, rated as happier than were the silver medalists. In a follow-up study, raters watched interviews with many of these same athletes as they talked about their performance. The raters indicated what we would expect on the basis of counterfactual thinking—the silver medalists talked about their disappointments in having finished second rather than first, whereas the bronze medalists focused on how happy they were to have finished third rather than fourth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p04">You might have experienced counterfactual thinking in other situations. Once I was driving across country, and my car was having some engine trouble. I really wanted to make it home when I got near the end of my journey; I would have been extremely disappointed if the car broke down only a few miles from my home. Perhaps you have noticed that once you get close to finishing something, you feel like you really need to get it done. Counterfactual thinking has even been observed in juries. Jurors who were asked to award monetary damages to others who had been in an accident offered them substantially more in compensation if they barely avoided injury than they offered if the accident seemed inevitable (Miller, Turnbull, &amp; McFarland, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_084">Miller, D.

            <h3 class="title">Psychology in Everyday Life: Cognitive Biases in the Real World</h3>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p05">Perhaps you are thinking that the kinds of errors that we have been talking about don’t seem that important. After all, who really cares if we think there are more words that begin with the letter “R” than there actually are, or if bronze medal winners are happier than the silver medalists? These aren’t big problems in the overall scheme of things. But it turns out that what seem to be relatively small cognitive biases on the surface can have profound consequences for people.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p06">Why would so many people continue to purchase lottery tickets, buy risky investments in the stock market, or gamble their money in casinos when the likelihood of them ever winning is so low? One possibility is that they are victims of salience; they focus their attention on the salient likelihood of a big win, forgetting that the base rate of the event occurring is very low. The belief in astrology, which all scientific evidence suggests is not accurate, is probably driven in part by the salience of the occasions when the predictions are correct. When a horoscope comes true (which will, of course, happen sometimes), the correct prediction is highly salient and may allow people to maintain the overall false belief.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p07">People may also take more care to prepare for unlikely events than for more likely ones, because the unlikely ones are more salient. For instance, people may think that they are more likely to die from a terrorist attack or a homicide than they are from diabetes, stroke, or tuberculosis. But the odds are much greater of dying from the latter than the former. And people are frequently more afraid of flying than driving, although the likelihood of dying in a car crash is hundreds of times greater than dying in a plane crash (more than 50,000 people are killed on U.S. highways every year). Because people don’t accurately calibrate their behaviors to match the true potential risks (e.g., they drink and drive or don’t wear their seatbelts), the individual and societal level costs are often quite large (Slovic, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_085">Slovic, P. (Ed.). (2000). <em class="emphasis">The perception of risk</em>. London, England: Earthscan Publications.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p08">Salience and accessibility also color how we perceive our social worlds, which may have a big influence on our behavior. For instance, people who watch a lot of violent television shows also view the world as more dangerous (Doob &amp; Macdonald, 1979),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_086">Doob, A. N., &amp; Macdonald, G. E. (1979). Television viewing and fear of victimization: Is the relationship causal? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(2), 170–179.</span> probably because violence becomes more cognitively accessible for them. We also unfairly overestimate our contribution to joint projects (Ross &amp; Sicoly, 1979),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_087">Ross, M., &amp; Sicoly, F. (1979). Egocentric biases in availability and attribution. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(3), 322–336.</span> perhaps in part because our own contributions are highly accessible, whereas the contributions of others are much less so.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p09">Even people who should know better, and who <em class="emphasis">need</em> to know better, are subject to cognitive biases. Economists, stock traders, managers, lawyers, and even doctors make the same kinds of mistakes in their professional activities that people make in their everyday lives (Gilovich, Griffin, &amp; Kahneman, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_088">Gilovich, T., Griffin, D., &amp; Kahneman, D. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Heuristics and biases: The psychology of intuitive judgment</em>. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</span> Just like us, these people are victims of overconfidence, heuristics, and other biases.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p10">Furthermore, every year thousands of individuals, such as Ronald Cotton, are charged with and often convicted of crimes based largely on eyewitness evidence. When eyewitnesses testify in courtrooms regarding their memories of a crime, they often are completely sure that they are identifying the right person. But the most common cause of innocent people being falsely convicted is erroneous eyewitness testimony (Wells, Wright, &amp; Bradfield, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_089">Wells, G. L., Wright, E. F., &amp; Bradfield, A. L. (1999). Witnesses to crime: Social and cognitive factors governing the validity of people’s reports. In R. Roesch, S. D. Hart, &amp; J. R. P. Ogloff (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Psychology and law: The state of the discipline</em> (pp. 53–87). Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers.</span> The many people who were convicted by mistaken eyewitnesses prior to the advent of forensic DNA and who have now been exonerated by DNA tests have certainly paid for all-too-common memory errors (Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_090">Wells, G. L., Memon, A., &amp; Penrod, S. D. (2006). Eyewitness evidence: Improving its probative value. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 7</em>(2), 45–75.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_s03_s07_p11">Although cognitive biases are common, they are not impossible to control, and psychologists and other scientists are working to help people make better decisions. One possibility is to provide people with better feedback about their judgments. Weather forecasters, for instance, learn to be quite accurate in their judgments because they have clear feedback about the accuracy of their predictions. Other research has found that accessibility biases can be reduced by leading people to consider multiple alternatives rather than focus only on the most obvious ones, and particularly by leading people to think about opposite possible outcomes than the ones they are expecting (Lilienfeld, Ammirtai, &amp; Landfield, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_091">Lilienfeld, S.
