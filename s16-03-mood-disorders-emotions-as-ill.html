In addition to the loss of interest, productivity, and social contact that accompanies depression, the person’s sense of hopelessness and sadness may become so severe that he or she considers or even succeeds in committing suicide. Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States, and a suicide occurs approximately every 16 minutes.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s01_p01">The level of depression observed in people with mood disorders varies widely. People who experience depression for many years, such that it becomes to seem normal and part of their everyday life, and who feel that they are rarely or never happy, will likely be diagnosed with a mood disorder. If the depression is mild but long-lasting, they will be diagnosed with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dysthymia</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder characterized by mild, but chronic, depressive symptoms that last for at least 2 years.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a condition characterized by mild, but chronic, depressive symptoms that last for at least 2 years</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s01_p02">If the depression continues and becomes even more severe, the diagnosis may become that of <em class="emphasis">major depressive disorder</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Major depressive disorder (clinical depression)</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder characterized by an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem and by loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a mental disorder characterized by an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem and by loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities</em>. Those who suffer from major depressive disorder feel an intense sadness, despair, and loss of interest in pursuits that once gave them pleasure. These negative feelings profoundly limit the individual’s day-to-day functioning and ability to maintain and develop interests in life (Fairchild &amp; Scogin, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_071">Fairchild, K., &amp; Scogin, F.

            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s02_p01">Juliana is a 21-year-old single woman. Over the past several years she had been treated by a psychologist for depression, but for the past few months she had been feeling a lot better. Juliana had landed a good job in a law office and found a steady boyfriend. She told her friends and parents that she had been feeling particularly good—her energy level was high and she was confident in herself and her life.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s02_p02">One day Juliana was feeling so good that she impulsively quit her new job and left town with her boyfriend on a road trip. But the trip didn’t turn out well because Juliana became impulsive, impatient, and easily angered. Her euphoria continued, and in one of the towns that they visited she left her boyfriend and went to a party with some strangers that she had met. She danced into the early morning and ended up having sex with several of the men.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s02_p03">Eventually Juliana returned home to ask for money, but when her parents found out about her recent behavior, and when she acted aggressively and abusively to them when they confronted her about it, they referred her to a social worker. Juliana was hospitalized, where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s02_p04">While dysthymia and major depressive disorder are characterized by overwhelming negative moods, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bipolar disorder</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder characterized by swings in mood from overly “high” to sad and hopeless, and back again, with periods of near-normal mood in between.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a psychological disorder characterized by swings in mood from overly “high” to sad and hopeless, and back again, with periods of near-normal mood in between</em>. Bipolar disorder is diagnosed in cases such as Juliana’s, where experiences with depression are followed by a more normal period and then a period of mania or euphoria in which the person feels particularly awake, alive, excited, and involved in everyday activities but is also impulsive, agitated, and distracted. Without treatment, it is likely that Juliana would cycle back into depression and then eventually into mania again, with the likelihood that she would harm herself or others in the process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s02_p05">Bipolar disorder is an often chronic and lifelong condition that may begin in childhood. Although the normal pattern involves swings from high to low, in some cases the person may experience both highs and lows at the same time. Determining whether a person has bipolar disorder is difficult due to the frequent presence of comorbidity with both depression and anxiety disorders. Bipolar disorder is more likely to be diagnosed when it is initially observed at an early age, when the frequency of depressive episodes is high, and when there is a sudden onset of the symptoms (Bowden, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_074">Bowden, C.

Future of genetics of mood disorders research. <em class="emphasis">Biological Psychiatry, 52</em>(6), 457–477.</span> Neurotransmitters also play an important role in mood disorders.

Their research focused on a particular gene, the 5-HTT gene, which is known to be important in the production and use of the neurotransmitter <em class="emphasis">serotonin</em>. The researchers focused on this gene because serotonin is known to be important in depression, and because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in treating depression.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p04">People who experience stressful life events, for instance involving threat, loss, humiliation, or defeat, are likely to experience depression. But biological-situational models suggest that a person’s sensitivity to stressful events depends on his or her genetic makeup. The researchers therefore expected that people with one type of genetic pattern would show depression following stress to a greater extent than people with a different type of genetic pattern.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p05">The research included a sample of 1,037 adults from Dunedin, New Zealand. Genetic analysis on the basis of DNA samples allowed the researchers to divide the sample into two groups on the basis of the characteristics of their 5-HTT gene.

The events included employment, financial, housing, health, and relationship stressors. The dependent measure in the study was the level of depression reported by the participant, as assessed using a structured interview test (Robins, Cottler, Bucholtz, &amp; Compton, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_081">Robins, L.

Furthermore, for the participants who experienced 4 stressors over the past 5 years, 33% of the participants who carried the short version of the gene became depressed, whereas only 17% of participants who did not have the short version did.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_p09">But psychological and social determinants are also important in creating mood disorders and depression. In terms of psychological characteristics, mood states are influenced in large part by our cognitions. Negative thoughts about ourselves and our relationships to others create negative moods, and a goal of cognitive therapy for mood disorders is to attempt to change people’s cognitions to be more positive. Negative moods also create negative behaviors toward others, such as acting sad, slouching, and avoiding others, which may lead those others to respond negatively to the person, for instance by isolating that person, which then creates even more depression (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s03_s03_f02">Figure 12.13 "Cycle of Depression"</a>). You can see how it might become difficult for people to break out of this “cycle of depression.”</p>

Cross-national epidemiology of major depression and bipolar disorder. <em class="emphasis">Journal of the American Medical Association, 276</em>, 293–299.</span> found that rates of depression varied greatly among countries, with the highest rates in European and American countries and the lowest rates in Asian countries. These differences seem to be due to discrepancies between individual feelings and cultural expectations about what one <em class="emphasis">should</em> feel. People from European and American cultures report that it is important to experience emotions such as happiness and excitement, whereas the Chinese report that it is more important to be stable and calm. Because Americans may feel that they are not happy or excited but that they are supposed to be, this may increase their depression (Tsai, Knutson, &amp; Fung, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_083">Tsai, J.

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch12_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>Mood is the positive or negative feelings that are in the background of our everyday experiences.</li>
                <li>We all may get depressed in our daily lives, but people who suffer from mood disorders tend to experience more intense—and particularly more intense negative—moods.</li>
                <li>The most common symptom of mood disorders is negative mood.</li>
                <li>If a person experiences mild but long-lasting depression, she will be diagnosed with dysthymia. If the depression continues and becomes even more severe, the diagnosis may become that of major depressive disorder.</li>
                <li>Bipolar disorder is characterized by swings in mood from overly “high” to sad and hopeless, and back again, with periods of near-normal mood in between.</li>
