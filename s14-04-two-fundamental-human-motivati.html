        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p01">Along with the need to drink fresh water, which humans can normally attain in all except the most extreme situations, the need for food is the most fundamental and important human need. More than 1 in 10 U.S. households contain people who live without enough nourishing food, and this lack of proper nourishment has profound effects on their abilities to create effective lives (Hunger Notes, n.d.).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_093">Hunger Notes. (n.d.). How many children are hungry in the United States? Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/04/editorials/hungry_us_children.htm">http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/04/editorials/hungry_us_children.htm</a></span> When people are extremely hungry, their motivation to attain food completely changes their behavior. Hungry people become listless and apathetic to save energy and then become completely obsessed with food. Ancel Keys and his colleagues (Keys, Brožek, Henschel, Mickelsen, &amp; Taylor, 1950)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_094">Keys, A., Brožek, J., Henschel, A., Mickelsen, O., &amp; Taylor, H. L. (1950). <em class="emphasis">The biology of human starvation</em> (Vols. 1–2). Oxford, England: University of Minnesota Press.</span> found that volunteers who were placed on severely reduced-calorie diets lost all interest in sex and social activities, becoming preoccupied with food.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p02">Like most interesting psychological phenomena, the simple behavior of eating has both biological and social determinants (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s04_s01_f01">Figure 10.12 "Biological, Psychological, and Social-Cultural Contributors to Eating"</a>). Biologically, hunger is controlled by the interactions among complex pathways in the nervous system and a variety of hormonal and chemical systems in the brain and body. The stomach is of course important. We feel more hungry when our stomach is empty than when it is full. But we can also feel hunger even without input from the stomach. Two areas of the hypothalamus are known to be particularly important in eating. The lateral part of the hypothalamus responds primarily to cues to start eating, whereas the ventromedial part of the hypothalamus primarily responds to cues to stop eating. If the lateral part of the hypothalamus is damaged, the animal will not eat even if food is present, whereas if the ventromedial part of the hypothalamus is damaged, the animal will eat until it is obese (Wolf &amp; Miller, 1964).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_095">Wolf, G., &amp; Miller, N.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p03">Hunger is also determined by hormone levels (<a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch10_s04_s01_f02">Figure 10.13 "Eating Is Influenced by the Appetite Hormones"</a>). <em class="emphasis">Glucose</em> is the main sugar that the body uses for energy, and the brain monitors blood glucose levels to determine hunger. Glucose levels in the bloodstream are regulated by <em class="emphasis">insulin</em>, a hormone secreted by the pancreas gland. When insulin is low, glucose is not taken up by body cells, and the body begins to use fat as an energy source. Eating and appetite are also influenced by other hormones, including <em class="emphasis">orexin</em>, <em class="emphasis">ghrelin</em>, and <em class="emphasis">leptin</em> (Brennan &amp; Mantzoros, 2006; Nakazato et al., 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_096">Brennan, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p04">Normally the interaction of the various systems that determine hunger creates a balance or <em class="emphasis">homeostasis</em> in which we eat when we are hungry and stop eating when we feel full. But homeostasis varies among people; some people simply weigh more than others, and there is little they can do to change their fundamental weight. Weight is determined in large part by the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">basal metabolic rate</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of energy expended while at rest, which influences one’s weight.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the amount of energy expended while at rest</em>. Each person’s basal metabolic rate is different, due to his or her unique physical makeup and physical behavior. A naturally occurring low metabolic rate, which is determined entirely by genetics, makes weight management a very difficult undertaking for many people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p05">How we eat is also influenced by our environment. When researchers rigged clocks to move faster, people got hungrier and ate more, as if they thought they must be hungry again because so much time had passed since they last ate (Schachter, 1968).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_097">Schachter, S. (1968). Obesity and eating. <em class="emphasis">Science, 161</em>(3843), 751–756.</span> And if we forget that we have already eaten, we are likely to eat again even if we are not actually hungry (Rozin, Dow, Moscovitch, &amp; Rajaram, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_098">Rozin, P., Dow, S., Moscovitch, M., &amp; Rajaram, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_p06">Cultural norms about appropriate weights also influence eating behaviors. Current norms for women in Western societies are based on a very thin body ideal, emphasized by television and movie actresses, models, and even children’s dolls, such as the ever-popular Barbie. These norms for excessive thinness are very difficult for most women to attain: Barbie’s measurements, if translated to human proportions, would be about 36 in.-18 in.-33 in. at bust-waist-hips, measurements that are attained by less than 1 in 100,000 women (Norton, Olds, Olive, &amp; Dank, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_099">Norton, K.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Eating Disorders</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p01">In some cases, the desire to be thin can lead to eating disorders, which are estimated to affect about 1 million males and 10 million females the United States alone (Hoek &amp; van Hoeken, 2003; Patrick, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_100">Hoek, H.

Nine out of 10 sufferers are women. Anorexia begins with a severe weight loss diet and develops into a preoccupation with food and dieting.</p>

Bulimia nervosa begins after the dieter has broken a diet and gorged. Bulimia involves repeated episodes of overeating, followed by vomiting, laxative use, fasting, or excessive exercise. It is most common in women in their late teens or early 20s, and it is often accompanied by depression and anxiety, particularly around the time of the binging. The cycle in which the person eats to feel better, but then after eating becomes concerned about weight gain and purges, repeats itself over and over again, often with major psychological and physical results.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p03">Eating disorders are in part heritable (Klump, Burt, McGue, &amp; Iacono, 2007),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_101">Klump, K.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_s02_p03">Obesity is a leading cause of death worldwide. Its prevalence is rapidly increasing, and it is one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Although obesity is caused in part by genetics, it is increased by overeating and a lack of physical activity (Nestle &amp; Jacobson, 2000; James, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_108">Nestle, M., &amp; Jacobson, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s01_s02_p04">There are really only two approaches to controlling weight: eat less and exercise more. Dieting is difficult for anyone, but it is particularly difficult for people with slow basal metabolic rates, who must cope with severe hunger to lose weight. Although most weight loss can be maintained for about a year, very few people are able to maintain substantial weight loss through dieting alone for more than three years (Miller, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_109">Miller, W. C. (1999). How effective are traditional dietary and exercise interventions for weight loss? <em class="emphasis">Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, 31</em>(8), 1129–1134.</span> Substantial weight loss of more than 50 pounds is typically seen only when weight loss surgery has been performed (Douketis, Macie, Thabane, &amp; Williamson, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_110">Douketis, J.

The vast majority of human beings have a heterosexual orientation—their sexual desire is focused toward members of the opposite sex. A smaller minority is primarily homosexual (i.e., they have sexual desire for members of their own sex). Between 3% and 4% of men are gay, and between 1% and 2% of women are lesbian. Another 1% of the population reports being bisexual (having desires for both sexes). The love and sexual lives of homosexuals are little different from those of heterosexuals, except where their behaviors are constrained by cultural norms and local laws. As with heterosexuals, some gays and lesbians are celibate, some are promiscuous, but most are in committed, long-term relationships (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, &amp; Michaels, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_131">Laumann, E.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch10_s04_s02_s02_p03">Although homosexuality has been practiced as long as records of human behavior have been kept, and occurs in many animals at least as frequently as it does in humans, cultures nevertheless vary substantially in their attitudes toward it. In Western societies such as the United States and Europe, attitudes are becoming progressively more tolerant of homosexuality, but it remains unacceptable in many other parts of the world. The American Psychiatric Association no longer considers homosexuality to be a “mental illness,” although it did so until 1973. Because prejudice against gays and lesbians can lead to experiences of ostracism, depression, and even suicide (Kulkin, Chauvin, &amp; Percle, 2000),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn10_132">Kulkin, H.
