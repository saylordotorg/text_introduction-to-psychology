    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p01">To this point in the chapter we have considered the psychological disorders that fall on Axis I of the <em class="emphasis">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<em class="emphasis">DSM</em>) categorization system. In comparison to the Axis I disorders, which may frequently be severe and dysfunctional and are often brought on by stress, the disorders that fall on Axis II are longer-term disorders that are less likely to be severely incapacitating. Axis II consists primarily of <em class="emphasis">personality disorders</em>. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personality disorder</a><span class="glossdef">A condition characterized by inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, or relating to others that causes problems in personal, social, and work situations.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a disorder characterized by inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, or relating to others that cause problems in personal, social, and work situations</em>. Personality disorders tend to emerge during late childhood or adolescence and usually continue throughout adulthood (Widiger, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_112">Widiger, T.A. (2006). Understanding personality disorders. In S. K. Huprich (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Rorschach assessment to the personality disorders. The LEA series in personality and clinical psychology</em> (pp. 3–25). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span> The disorders can be problematic for the people who have them, but they are less likely to bring people to a therapist for treatment than are Axis I disorders.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p02">The personality disorders are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s05_t01">Table 12.6 "Descriptions of the Personality Disorders (Axis II)"</a>. They are categorized into three types: those characterized by <em class="emphasis">odd or eccentric behavior</em>, those characterized by <em class="emphasis">dramatic or erratic behavior</em>, and those characterized by <em class="emphasis">anxious or inhibited</em> behavior. As you consider the personality types described in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch12_s05_t01">Table 12.6 "Descriptions of the Personality Disorders (Axis II)"</a>, I’m sure you’ll think of people that you know who have each of these traits, at least to some degree. Probably you know someone who seems a bit suspicious and paranoid, who feels that other people are always “ganging up on him,” and who really doesn’t trust other people very much. Perhaps you know someone who fits the bill of being overly dramatic—the “drama queen” who is always raising a stir and whose emotions seem to turn everything into a big deal. Or you might have a friend who is overly dependent on others and can’t seem to get a life of her own.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p03">The personality traits that make up the personality disorders are common—we see them in the people whom we interact with every day—yet they may become problematic when they are rigid, overused, or interfere with everyday behavior (Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_113">Lynam, D., &amp; Widiger, T. (2001). Using the five-factor model to represent the <em class="emphasis">DSM-IV</em> personality disorders: An expert consensus approach. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 110</em>(3), 401–412.</span> What is perhaps common to all the disorders is the person’s inability to accurately understand and be sensitive to the motives and needs of the people around them.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p04">The personality disorders create a bit of a problem for diagnosis. For one, it is frequently difficult for the clinician to accurately diagnose which of the many personality disorders a person has, although the friends and colleagues of the person can generally do a good job of it (Oltmanns &amp; Turkheimer, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_114">Oltmanns, T. F., &amp; Turkheimer, E. (2006). Perceptions of self and others regarding pathological personality traits. In R. F. Krueger &amp; J. L. Tackett (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Personality and psychopathology</em> (pp. 71–111). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> And the personality disorders are highly comorbid; if a person has one, it’s likely that he or she has others as well. Also, the number of people with personality disorders is estimated to be as high as 15% of the population (Grant et al., 2004),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_115">Grant, B., Hasin, D., Stinson, F., Dawson, D., Chou, S., Ruan, W., &amp; Pickering, R.

Prevalence, correlates, and disability of personality disorders in the United States: Results from the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 65</em>(7), 948–958.</span> which might make us wonder if these are really “disorders” in any real sense of the word.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p05">Although they are considered as separate disorders, the personality disorders are essentially milder versions of more severe Axis I disorders (Huang et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_116">Huang, Y., Kotov, R., de Girolamo, G., Preti, A., Angermeyer, M., Benjet, C.,…Kessler, R.

This overlap in classification causes some confusion, and some theorists have argued that the personality disorders should be eliminated from the <em class="emphasis">DSM</em>. But clinicians normally differentiate Axis I and Axis II disorders, and thus the distinction is useful for them (Krueger, 2005; Phillips, Yen, &amp; Gunderson, 2003; Verheul, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_117">Krueger, R.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_p06">Although it is not possible to consider the characteristics of each of the personality disorders in this book, let’s focus on two that have important implications for behavior. The first, <em class="emphasis">borderline personality disorder (BPD)</em>, is important because it is so often associated with suicide, and the second, <em class="emphasis">antisocial personality disorder (APD)</em>, because it is the foundation of criminal behavior. Borderline and antisocial personality disorders are also good examples to consider because they are so clearly differentiated in terms of their focus. BPD (more frequently found in women than men) is known as an <em class="emphasis">internalizing disorder</em> because the behaviors that it entails (e.g., suicide and self-mutilation) are mostly directed toward the self. APD (mostly found in men), on the other hand, is a type of <em class="emphasis">externalizing disorder</em> in which the problem behaviors (e.g., lying, fighting, vandalism, and other criminal activity) focus primarily on harm to others.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Borderline personality disorder (BPD)</a><span class="glossdef">A condition characterized by a prolonged disturbance of personality accompanied by mood swings, unstable personal relationships, identity problems, threats of self-destructive behavior, fears of abandonment, and impulsivity.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a psychological disorder characterized by a prolonged disturbance of personality accompanied by mood swings, unstable personal relationships, identity problems, threats of self-destructive behavior, fears of abandonment, and impulsivity</em>. BPD is widely diagnosed—up to 20% of psychiatric patients are given the diagnosis, and it may occur in up to 2% of the general population (Hyman, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_118">Hyman, S. E. (2002). A new beginning for research on borderline personality disorder. <em class="emphasis">Biological Psychiatry, 51</em>(12), 933–935.</span> About three quarters of diagnosed cases of BDP are women.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p02">People with BPD fear being abandoned by others. They often show a clinging dependency on the other person and engage in manipulation to try to maintain the relationship. They become angry if the other person limits the relationship, but also deny that they care about the person. As a defense against fear of abandonment, borderline people are compulsively social. But their behaviors, including their intense anger, demands, and suspiciousness, repel people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p03">People with BPD often deal with stress by engaging in self-destructive behaviors, for instance by being sexually promiscuous, getting into fights, binge eating and purging, engaging in self-mutilation or drug abuse, and threatening suicide. These behaviors are designed to call forth a “saving” response from the other person. People with BPD are a continuing burden for police, hospitals, and therapists. Borderline individuals also show disturbance in their concepts of identity: They are uncertain about self-image, gender identity, values, loyalties, and goals. They may have chronic feelings of emptiness or boredom and be unable to tolerate being alone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p04">BPD has both genetic as well as environmental roots. In terms of genetics, research has found that those with BPD frequently have neurotransmitter imbalances (Zweig-Frank et al., 2006),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_119">Zweig-Frank, H., Paris, J., Kin, N. M. N. Y., Schwartz, G., Steiger, H., &amp; Nair, N. P. V. (2006). Childhood sexual abuse in relation to neurobiological challenge tests in patients with borderline personality disorder and normal controls. <em class="emphasis">Psychiatry Research, 141</em>(3), 337–341.</span> and the disorder is heritable (Minzenberg, Poole, &amp; Vinogradov, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_120">Minzenberg, M. J., Poole, J. H., &amp; Vinogradov, S. (2008).

Some theories focus on the development of attachment in early childhood, while others point to parents who fail to provide adequate attention to the child’s feelings. Others focus on parental abuse (both sexual and physical) in adolescence, as well as on divorce, alcoholism, and other stressors (Lobbestael &amp; Arntz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_121">Lobbestael, J., &amp; Arntz, A.

The problems are amplified when the diagnosis is comorbid (as it often is) with other disorders, such as substance abuse disorder, major depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Skodol et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn12_122">Skodol, A.

Specifically, they hypothesized that the fast emotional pathway through the amygdala is too active, and the slow cognitive-emotional pathway through the prefrontal cortex is not active enough in those with BPD.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p06">The participants in their research were 16 patients with BPD and 14 healthy comparison participants. All participants were tested in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine while they performed a task that required them to read emotional and nonemotional words, and then press a button as quickly as possible whenever a word appeared in a normal font and not press the button whenever the word appeared in an italicized font.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s01_p07">The researchers found that while all participants performed the task well, the patients with BPD had more errors than the controls (both in terms of pressing the button when they should not have and not pressing it when they should have). These errors primarily occurred on the negative emotional words.</p>

In comparison to the controls, the borderline patients showed relatively larger affective responses when they were attempting to quickly respond to the negative emotions, and showed less cognitive activity in the prefrontal cortex in the same conditions.

APD is <em class="emphasis">a pervasive pattern of violation of the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood</em>. APD is about three times more likely to be diagnosed in men than in women. To be diagnosed with APD the person must be 18 years of age or older and have a documented history of conduct disorder before the age of 15. People having antisocial personality disorder are sometimes referred to as “sociopaths” or “psychopaths.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch12_s05_s02_p02">People with APD feel little distress for the pain they cause others. They lie, engage in violence against animals and people, and frequently have drug and alcohol abuse problems. They are egocentric and frequently impulsive, for instance suddenly changing jobs or relationships. People with APD soon end up with a criminal record and often spend time incarcerated.
