        <h3 class="title">She Was Certain, but She Was Wrong</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p01">In 1984 Jennifer Thompson was a 22-year-old college student in North Carolina. One night a man broke into her apartment, put a knife to her throat, and raped her. According to her own account, Ms. Thompson studied her rapist throughout the incident with great determination to memorize his face. She said:</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch08_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p02">I studied every single detail on the rapist’s face. I looked at his hairline; I looked for scars, for tattoos, for anything that would help me identify him. When and if I survived.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p03">Ms. Thompson went to the police that same day to create a sketch of her attacker, relying on what she believed was her detailed memory. Several days later, the police constructed a photographic lineup. Thompson identified Ronald Cotton as the rapist, and she later testified against him at trial. She was positive it was him, with no doubt in her mind.</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="stangor-ch08_bl02">
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p04">I was sure. I knew it. I had picked the right guy, and he was going to go to jail. If there was the possibility of a death sentence, I wanted him to die. I wanted to flip the switch.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p05">As positive as she was, it turned out that Jennifer Thompson was wrong. But it was not until after Mr. Cotton had served 11 years in prison for a crime he did not commit that conclusive DNA evidence indicated that Bobby Poole was the actual rapist, and Cotton was released from jail. Jennifer Thompson’s memory had failed her, resulting in a substantial injustice. It took definitive DNA testing to shake her confidence, but she now knows that despite her confidence in her identification, it was wrong. Consumed by guilt, Thompson sought out Cotton when he was released from prison, and they have since become friends (Innocence Project, n.d.; Thompson, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_001">Innocence Project.

Over the past 10 years, almost 400 people have been released from prison when DNA evidence confirmed that they could not have committed the crime for which they had been convicted. And in more than three-quarters of these cases, the cause of the innocent people being falsely convicted was erroneous eyewitness testimony (Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_002">Wells, G.

It is useful to consider memory and cognition in the same chapter because they work together to help us interpret and understand our environments.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p08">Memory and cognition represent the two major interests of cognitive psychologists. The cognitive approach became the most important school of psychology during the 1960s, and the field of psychology has remained in large part cognitive since that time. The cognitive school was influenced in large part by the development of the electronic computer, and although the differences between computers and the human mind are vast, cognitive psychologists have used the computer as a model for understanding the workings of the mind.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Differences between Brains and Computers</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch08_l01">
            <li>In computers, information can be accessed only if one knows the exact location of the memory. In the brain, information can be accessed through <em class="emphasis">spreading activation</em> from closely related concepts.</li>
            <li>The brain operates primarily in parallel, meaning that it is multitasking on many different actions at the same time. Although this is changing as new computers are developed, most computers are primarily serial—they finish one task before they start another.</li>
            <li>In computers, short-term (random-access) memory is a subset of long-term (read-only) memory. In the brain, the processes of short-term memory and long-term memory are distinct.</li>
            <li>In the brain, there is no difference between hardware (the mechanical aspects of the computer) and software (the programs that run on the hardware).</li>
            <li>In the brain, synapses, which operate using an electrochemical process, are much slower but also vastly more complex and useful than the transistors used by computers.</li>
            <li>Computers differentiate memory (e.g., the hard drive) from processing (the central processing unit), but in brains there is no such distinction. In the brain (but not in computers) existing memory is used to interpret and store incoming information, and retrieving information from memory changes the memory itself.</li>
            <li>The brain is self-organizing and self-repairing, but computers are not. If a person suffers a stroke, neural plasticity will help him or her recover. If we drop our laptop and it breaks, it cannot fix itself.</li>
            <li>The brain is significantly bigger than any current computer. The brain is estimated to have 25,000,000,000,000,000 (25 million billion) interactions among axons, dendrites, neurons, and neurotransmitters, and that doesn’t include the approximately 1 trillion glial cells that may also be important for information processing and memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch08_p09">Although cognitive psychology began in earnest at about the same time that the electronic computer was first being developed, and although cognitive psychologists have frequently used the computer as a model for understanding how the brain operates, research in cognitive neuroscience has revealed many important differences between brains and computers. The neuroscientist Chris Chatham (2007)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_003">Chatham, C.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p10">We will begin the chapter with the study of memory. Our memories allow us to do relatively simple things, such as remembering where we parked our car or the name of the current president of the United States, but also allow us to form complex memories, such as how to ride a bicycle or to write a computer program. Moreover, our memories define us as individuals—they are our experiences, our relationships, our successes, and our failures. Without our memories, we would not have a life.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p11">At least for some things, our memory is very good (Bahrick, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_004">Bahrick, H. P. (2000).

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p13">In this chapter we will see how psychologists use behavioral responses (such as memory tests and reaction times) to draw inferences about what and how people remember. And we will see that although we have very good memory for some things, our memories are far from perfect (Schacter, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_008">Schacter, D. L. (1996). <em class="emphasis">Searching for memory: The brain, the mind, and the past</em> (1st ed.). New York, NY: Basic Books.</span> The errors that we make are due to the fact that our memories are not simply recording devices that input, store, and retrieve the world around us. Rather, we actively process and interpret information as we remember and recollect it, and these cognitive processes influence what we remember and how we remember it. Because memories are constructed, not recorded, when we remember events we don’t reproduce exact replicas of those events (Bartlett, 1932).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_009">Bartlett, F. C. (1932). <em class="emphasis">Remembering</em>. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p14">In the last section of the chapter we will focus primarily on cognition, with a particular consideration for cases in which cognitive processes lead us to distort our judgments or misremember information. We will see that our prior knowledge can influence our memory. People who read the words “<em class="emphasis">dream</em>, <em class="emphasis">sheets</em>, <em class="emphasis">rest</em>, <em class="emphasis">snore</em>, <em class="emphasis">blanket</em>, <em class="emphasis">tired</em>, and <em class="emphasis">bed</em>” and then are asked to remember the words often think that they saw the word <em class="emphasis">sleep</em> even though that word was not in the list (Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn08_010">Roediger, H. L., &amp; McDermott, K. B. (1995). Creating false memories: Remembering words not presented in lists. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21</em>(4), 803–814.</span> And we will see that in other cases we are influenced by the ease with which we can retrieve information from memory or by the information that we are exposed to after we first learn something.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch08_p15">Although much research in the area of memory and cognition is basic in orientation, the work also has profound influence on our everyday experiences. Our cognitive processes influence the accuracy and inaccuracy of our memories and our judgments, and they lead us to be vulnerable to the types of errors that eyewitnesses such as Jennifer Thompson may make. Understanding these potential errors is the first step in learning to avoid them.</p>
