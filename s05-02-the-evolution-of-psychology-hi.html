    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_p02">The approaches that psychologists have used to assess the issues that interest them have changed dramatically over the history of psychology. Perhaps most importantly, the field has moved steadily from speculation about behavior toward a more objective and scientific approach as the technology available to study human behavior has improved (Benjamin &amp; Baker, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_011">Benjamin, L. T., Jr., &amp; Baker, D. B. (2004). <em class="emphasis">From seance to science: A history of the profession of psychology in America</em>. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson.</span> There has also been an increasing influx of women into the field. Although most early psychologists were men, now most psychologists, including the presidents of the most important psychological organizations, are women.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_p03">Although psychology has changed dramatically over its history, the most important questions that psychologists address have remained constant. Some of these questions follow, and we will discuss them both in this chapter and in the chapters to come:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_l02">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Nature versus nurture.</em> Are genes or environment most influential in determining the behavior of individuals and in accounting for differences among people? Most scientists now agree that both genes and environment play crucial roles in most human behaviors, and yet we still have much to learn about how nature (our biological makeup) and nurture (the experiences that we have during our lives) work together (Harris, 1998; Pinker, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_012">Harris, J. (1998). <em class="emphasis">The nurture assumption: Why children turn out the way they do</em>. New York, NY: Touchstone Books; Pinker, S. (2002). <em class="emphasis">The blank slate: The modern denial of human nature</em>. New York, NY: Penguin Putnam.</span> <em class="emphasis">The proportion of the observed differences on characteristics among people (e.g., in terms of their height, intelligence, or optimism) that is due to genetics</em> is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">heritability</a><span class="glossdef">The proportion of the observed differences on characteristics among people (e.g., in terms of their height, intelligence, or optimism) that is due to genetics.</span></span> of the characteristic, and we will make much use of this term in the chapters to come. We will see, for example, that the heritability of intelligence is very high (about .85 out of 1.0) and that the heritability of extraversion is about .50. But we will also see that nature and nurture interact in complex ways, making the question of “Is it nature or is it nurture?” very difficult to answer.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Free will versus determinism.</em> This question concerns the extent to which people have control over their own actions. Are we the products of our environment, guided by forces out of our control, or are we able to choose the behaviors we engage in? Most of us like to believe in free will, that we are able to do what we want—for instance, that we could get up right now and go fishing. And our legal system is premised on the concept of free will; we punish criminals because we believe that they have choice over their behaviors and freely choose to disobey the law. But as we will discuss later in the research focus in this section, recent research has suggested that we may have less control over our own behavior than we think we do (Wegner, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_013">Wegner, D. M. (2002). <em class="emphasis">The illusion of conscious will</em>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</span>
</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Accuracy versus inaccuracy.</em> To what extent are humans good information processors? Although it appears that people are “good enough” to make sense of the world around them and to make decent decisions (Fiske, 2003),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_014">Fiske, S. T. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Social beings</em>. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.</span> they are far from perfect. Human judgment is sometimes compromised by inaccuracies in our thinking styles and by our motivations and emotions. For instance, our judgment may be affected by our desires to gain material wealth and to see ourselves positively and by emotional responses to the events that happen to us.</li>

    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_l03">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Conscious versus unconscious processing.</em> To what extent are we conscious of our own actions and the causes of them, and to what extent are our behaviors caused by influences that we are not aware of? Many of the major theories of psychology, ranging from the Freudian psychodynamic theories to contemporary work in cognitive psychology, argue that much of our behavior is determined by variables that we are not aware of.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Differences versus similarities.</em> To what extent are we all similar, and to what extent are we different? For instance, are there basic psychological and personality differences between men and women, or are men and women by and large similar? And what about people from different ethnicities and cultures? Are people around the world generally the same, or are they influenced by their backgrounds and environments in different ways? Personality, social, and cross-cultural psychologists attempt to answer these classic questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Early Psychologists</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s01_p01">The earliest psychologists that we know about are the Greek philosophers Plato (428–347 BC) and Aristotle (384–322 BC). These philosophers asked many of the same questions that today’s psychologists ask; for instance, they questioned the distinction between nature and nurture and the existence of free will. In terms of the former, Plato argued on the nature side, believing that certain kinds of knowledge are innate or inborn, whereas Aristotle was more on the nurture side, believing that each child is born as an “empty slate” (in Latin a <em class="emphasis">tabula rasa</em>) and that knowledge is primarily acquired through learning and experience.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s01_p02">European philosophers continued to ask these fundamental questions during the Renaissance. For instance, the French philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) also considered the issue of free will, arguing in its favor and believing that the mind controls the body through the pineal gland in the brain (an idea that made some sense at the time but was later proved incorrect). Descartes also believed in the existence of innate natural abilities. A scientist as well as a philosopher, Descartes dissected animals and was among the first to understand that the nerves controlled the muscles. He also addressed the relationship between mind (the mental aspects of life) and body (the physical aspects of life). Descartes believed in the principle of <em class="emphasis">dualism</em>: that the mind is fundamentally different from the mechanical body. Other European philosophers, including Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), John Locke (1632–1704), and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), also weighed in on these issues.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s01_p03">The fundamental problem that these philosophers faced was that they had few methods for settling their claims. Most philosophers didn’t conduct any research on these questions, in part because they didn’t yet know how to do it, and in part because they weren’t sure it was even possible to objectively study human experience. But dramatic changes came during the 1800s with the help of the first two research psychologists: the German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), who developed a psychology laboratory in Leipzig, Germany, and the American psychologist William James (1842–1910), who founded a psychology laboratory at Harvard University.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Structuralism: Introspection and the Awareness of Subjective Experience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s02_p01">Wundt’s research in his laboratory in Liepzig focused on the nature of consciousness itself. Wundt and his students believed that it was possible to analyze the basic elements of the mind and to classify our conscious experiences scientifically. Wundt began the field known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">structuralism</a><span class="glossdef">A school of psychology whose goal was to identify the basic elements (or “structures”) of psychological experience.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a school of psychology whose goal was to identify the basic elements or “structures” of psychological experience</em>. Its goal was to create a “periodic table” of the “elements of sensations,” similar to the periodic table of elements that had recently been created in chemistry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s02_p02">Structuralists used the method of <em class="emphasis">introspection</em> to attempt to create a map of the elements of consciousness. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Introspection</a><span class="glossdef">A method of learning about psychological processes in which research participants are asked to describe exactly what they experience as they work on mental tasks.</span></span> involves <em class="emphasis">asking research participants to describe exactly what they experience as they work on mental tasks</em>, such as viewing colors, reading a page in a book, or performing a math problem. A participant who is reading a book might report, for instance, that he saw some black and colored straight and curved marks on a white background. In other studies the structuralists used newly invented reaction time instruments to systematically assess not only what the participants were thinking but how long it took them to do so. Wundt discovered that it took people longer to report what sound they had just heard than to simply respond that they had heard the sound. These studies marked the first time researchers realized that there is a difference between the <em class="emphasis">sensation</em> of a stimulus and the <em class="emphasis">perception</em> of that stimulus, and the idea of using reaction times to study mental events has now become a mainstay of cognitive psychology.</p>

            <p class="para">Wilhelm Wundt (seated at left) and Edward Titchener (right) helped create the structuralist school of psychology. Their goal was to classify the elements of sensation through introspection.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s02_p03">Perhaps the best known of the structuralists was Edward Bradford Titchener (1867–1927). Titchener was a student of Wundt who came to the United States in the late 1800s and founded a laboratory at Cornell University. In his research using introspection, Titchener and his students claimed to have identified more than 40,000 sensations, including those relating to vision, hearing, and taste.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s02_p04">An important aspect of the structuralist approach was that it was rigorous and scientific. The research marked the beginning of psychology as a science, because it demonstrated that mental events could be quantified. But the structuralists also discovered the limitations of introspection. Even highly trained research participants were often unable to report on their subjective experiences. When the participants were asked to do simple math problems, they could easily do them, but they could not easily answer <em class="emphasis">how</em> they did them. Thus the structuralists were the first to realize the importance of unconscious processes—that many important aspects of human psychology occur outside our conscious awareness, and that psychologists cannot expect research participants to be able to accurately report on all of their experiences.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Functionalism and Evolutionary Psychology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s03_p01">In contrast to Wundt, who attempted to understand the nature of consciousness, the goal of William James and the other members of the school of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">functionalism</a><span class="glossdef">A school of psychology whose goal was to understand why animals and humans have developed the particular psychological aspects that they currently possess.</span></span> was <em class="emphasis">to understand why animals and humans have developed the particular psychological aspects that they currently possess</em> (Hunt, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_015">Hunt, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s03_p02">James and the other members of the functionalist school were influenced by Charles Darwin’s (1809–1882) <em class="emphasis">theory of natural selection</em>, which proposed that the physical characteristics of animals and humans evolved because they were useful, or functional. The functionalists believed that Darwin’s theory applied to psychological characteristics too. Just as some animals have developed strong muscles to allow them to run fast, the human brain, so functionalists thought, must have adapted to serve a particular function in human experience.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s03_p03">Although functionalism no longer exists as a school of psychology, its basic principles have been absorbed into psychology and continue to influence it in many ways. The work of the functionalists has developed into the field of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">evolutionary psychology</a><span class="glossdef">A branch of psychology that applies the Darwinian theory of natural selection to human and animal behavior.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a branch of psychology that applies the Darwinian theory of natural selection to human and animal behavior</em> (Dennett, 1995; Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_017">Dennett, D.

As we will see in the chapters to come, evolutionary psychologists use evolutionary theory to understand many different behaviors including romantic attraction, stereotypes and prejudice, and even the causes of many psychological disorders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s03_p04">A key component of the ideas of evolutionary psychology is <em class="emphasis">fitness</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Fitness</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which having a given genetic characteristic helps an individual organism survive and reproduce at a higher rate than do other members of the species who do not have the characteristic.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the extent to which having a given characteristic helps the individual organism survive and reproduce at a higher rate than do other members of the species who do not have the characteristic</em>. Fitter organisms pass on their genes more successfully to later generations, making the characteristics that produce fitness more likely to become part of the organism’s nature than characteristics that do not produce fitness. For example, it has been argued that the emotion of jealousy has survived over time in men because men who experience jealousy are more fit than men who do not. According to this idea, the experience of jealously leads men to be more likely to protect their mates and guard against rivals, which increases their reproductive success (Buss, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_018">Buss, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s03_p05">Despite its importance in psychological theorizing, evolutionary psychology also has some limitations. One problem is that many of its predictions are extremely difficult to test. Unlike the fossils that are used to learn about the physical evolution of species, we cannot know which psychological characteristics our ancestors possessed or did not possess; we can only make guesses about this. Because it is difficult to directly test evolutionary theories, it is always possible that the explanations we apply are made up after the fact to account for observed data (Gould &amp; Lewontin, 1979).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_019">Gould, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s04_p02">Freud’s ideas were extended by other psychologists whom he influenced, including Carl Jung (1875–1961), Alfred Adler (1870–1937), Karen Horney (1855–1952), and Erik Erikson (1902–1994). These and others who follow the psychodynamic approach believe that it is possible to help the patient if the unconscious drives can be remembered, particularly through a deep and thorough exploration of the person’s early sexual experiences and current sexual desires. These explorations are revealed through talk therapy and dream analysis, in a process called <em class="emphasis">psychoanalysis</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s04_p03">The founders of the school of psychodynamics were primarily practitioners who worked with individuals to help them understand and confront their psychological symptoms. Although they did not conduct much research on their ideas, and although later, more sophisticated tests of their theories have not always supported their proposals, psychodynamics has nevertheless had substantial impact on the field of psychology, and indeed on thinking about human behavior more generally (Moore &amp; Fine, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_020">Moore, B.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s05_p01">Although they differed in approach, both structuralism and functionalism were essentially studies of the mind. The psychologists associated with the school of <em class="emphasis">behaviorism</em>, on the other hand, were reacting in part to the difficulties psychologists encountered when they tried to use introspection to understand behavior. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Behaviorism</a><span class="glossdef">A school of psychology that is based on the premise that it is not possible to objectively study the mind, and therefore that psychologists should limit their attention to the study of behavior itself.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a school of psychology that is based on the premise that it is not possible to objectively study the mind, and therefore that psychologists should limit their attention to the study of behavior itself</em>. Behaviorists believe that the human mind is a “black box” into which stimuli are sent and from which responses are received. They argue that there is no point in trying to determine what happens in the box because we can successfully predict behavior without knowing what happens inside the mind. Furthermore, behaviorists believe that it is possible to develop laws of learning that can explain all behaviors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s05_p02">The first behaviorist was the American psychologist John B. Watson (1878–1958). Watson was influenced in large part by the work of the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936), who had discovered that dogs would salivate at the sound of a tone that had previously been associated with the presentation of food. Watson and the other behaviorists began to use these ideas to explain how events that people and other organisms experienced in their environment (<em class="emphasis">stimuli</em>) could produce specific behaviors (<em class="emphasis">responses</em>). For instance, in Pavlov’s research the <em class="emphasis">stimulus</em> (either the food or, after learning, the tone) would produce the <em class="emphasis">response</em> of salivation in the dogs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s05_p03">In his research Watson found that systematically exposing a child to fearful stimuli in the presence of objects that did not themselves elicit fear could lead the child to respond with a fearful behavior to the presence of the stimulus (Watson &amp; Rayner, 1920; Beck, Levinson, &amp; Irons, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_021">Watson, J.

The child cried when he heard the noise. After several such pairings of the two stimuli, the child was again shown the rat. Now, however, he cried and tried to move away from the rat.</p>

Skinner used the ideas of stimulus and response, along with the application of rewards or <em class="emphasis">reinforcements</em>, to train pigeons and other animals. And he used the general principles of behaviorism to develop theories about how best to teach children and how to create societies that were peaceful and productive. Skinner even developed a method for studying thoughts and feelings using the behaviorist approach (Skinner, 1957, 1968, 1972).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_022">Skinner, B.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s05_p07">The behaviorist research program had important implications for the fundamental questions about nature and nurture and about free will. In terms of the nature-nurture debate, the behaviorists agreed with the nurture approach, believing that we are shaped exclusively by our environments. They also argued that there is no free will, but rather that our behaviors are determined by the events that we have experienced in our past. In short, this approach argues that organisms, including humans, are a lot like puppets in a show who don’t realize that other people are controlling them. Furthermore, although we do not cause our own actions, we nevertheless believe that we do because we don’t realize all the influences acting on our behavior.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s05_p08">Recent research in psychology has suggested that Skinner and the behaviorists might well have been right, at least in the sense that we overestimate our own free will in responding to the events around us (Libet, 1985; Matsuhashi &amp; Hallett, 2008; Wegner, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_023">Libet, B.

The letter on the screen changed every one-half second. The participants were asked, whenever they decided to, to press either of two buttons. Then they were asked to indicate which letter was showing on the screen when they decided to press the button. The researchers analyzed the brain images to see if they could predict which of the two buttons the participant was going to press, even before the letter at which he or she had indicated the decision to press a button. Suggesting that the intention to act occurred in the brain before the research participants became aware of it, the researchers found that the prefrontal cortex region of the brain showed activation that could be used to predict the button press as long as 10 seconds before the participants said that they decided which button to press.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s05_p09">Research has found that we are more likely to think that we control our behavior when the desire to act occurs immediately prior to the outcome, when the thought is consistent with the outcome, and when there are no other apparent causes for the behavior. Aarts, Custers, and Wegner (2005)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_025">Aarts, H., Custers, R., &amp; Wegner, D. M. (2005).

The participants pressed a button to stop the movement. When participants were exposed to words related to the location of the square just before they stopped its movement, they became more likely to think that they controlled the motion, even when it was actually the computer that stopped it.

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s05_p10">The idea that we are more likely to take ownership for our actions in some cases than in others is also seen in our attributions for success and failure. Because we normally expect that our behaviors will be met with success, when we are successful we easily believe that the success is the result of our own free will. When an action is met with failure, on the other hand, we are less likely to perceive this outcome as the result of our free will, and we are more likely to blame the outcome on luck or our teacher (Wegner, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_027">Wegner, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s06_p01">Science is always influenced by the technology that surrounds it, and psychology is no exception. Thus it is no surprise that beginning in the 1960s, growing numbers of psychologists began to think about the brain and about human behavior in terms of the computer, which was being developed and becoming publicly available at that time. The analogy between the brain and the computer, although by no means perfect, provided part of the impetus for a new school of psychology called <em class="emphasis">cognitive psychology</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive psychology</a><span class="glossdef">A field of psychology that studies mental processes, including perception, thinking, memory, and judgment.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a field of psychology that studies mental processes, including perception, thinking, memory, and judgment</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s06_p02">Although cognitive psychology began in earnest in the 1960s, earlier psychologists had also taken a cognitive orientation. Some of the important contributors to cognitive psychology include the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850–1909), who studied the ability of people to remember lists of words under different conditions, and the English psychologist Sir Frederic Bartlett (1886–1969), who studied the cognitive and social processes of remembering. Bartlett created short stories that were in some ways logical but also contained some very unusual and unexpected events. Bartlett discovered that people found it very difficult to recall the stories exactly, even after being allowed to study them repeatedly, and he hypothesized that the stories were difficult to remember because they did not fit the participants’ expectations about how stories should go. The idea that our memory is influenced by what we already know was also a major idea behind the cognitive-developmental stage model of Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980). Other important cognitive psychologists include Donald E. Broadbent (1926–1993), Daniel Kahneman (1934–), George Miller (1920–), Eleanor Rosch (1938–), and Amos Tversky (1937–1996).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s06_p14">In its argument that our thinking has a powerful influence on behavior, the cognitive approach provided a distinct alternative to behaviorism. According to cognitive psychologists, ignoring the mind itself will never be sufficient because people interpret the stimuli that they experience. For instance, when a boy turns to a girl on a date and says, “You are so beautiful,” a behaviorist would probably see that as a reinforcing (positive) stimulus. And yet the girl might not be so easily fooled. She might try to understand why the boy is making this particular statement at this particular time and wonder if he might be attempting to influence her through the comment. Cognitive psychologists maintain that when we take into consideration how stimuli are evaluated and interpreted, we understand behavior more deeply.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s06_p15">Cognitive psychology remains enormously influential today, and it has guided research in such varied fields as language, problem solving, memory, intelligence, education, human development, social psychology, and psychotherapy. The cognitive revolution has been given even more life over the past decade as the result of recent advances in our ability to see the brain in action using <em class="emphasis">neuroimaging</em> techniques. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Neuroimaging</a><span class="glossdef">The use of various techniques to provide pictures of the structure and function of the living brain.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">the use of various techniques to provide pictures of the structure and function of the living brain</em> (Ilardi &amp; Feldman, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_029">Ilardi, S.

We have already discussed the use of one neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the research focus earlier in this section, and we will discuss the use of neuroimaging techniques in many areas of psychology in the chapters to follow.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social-Cultural Psychology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s07_p01">A final school, which takes a higher level of analysis and which has had substantial impact on psychology, can be broadly referred to as the <em class="emphasis">social-cultural approach</em>.

Social-cultural psychologists are particularly concerned with how people perceive themselves and others, and how people influence each other’s behavior. For instance, social psychologists have found that we are attracted to others who are similar to us in terms of attitudes and interests (Byrne, 1969),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_030">Byrne, D. (1969). Attitudes and attraction. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Advances in experimental social psychology</em> (Vol. 4, pp. 35–89). New York, NY: Academic Press.</span> that we develop our own beliefs and attitudes by comparing our opinions to those of others (Festinger, 1954),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_031">Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. <em class="emphasis">Human Relations, 7</em>, 117–140.</span> and that we frequently change our beliefs and behaviors to be similar to those of the people we care about—a process known as <em class="emphasis">conformity</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s07_p02">An important aspect of social-cultural psychology are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social norms</a><span class="glossdef">The ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving that are shared by group members and are perceived by them as appropriate.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving that are shared by group members and perceived by them as appropriate</em> (Asch, 1952; Cialdini, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_032">Asch, S.

New York, NY: Harper Collins College.</span> Norms include customs, traditions, standards, and rules, as well as the general values of the group. Many of the most important social norms are determined by the <em class="emphasis">culture</em> in which we live, and these cultures are studied by <em class="emphasis">cross-cultural psychologists</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s07_p03">Psychologists have found that there is a fundamental difference in social norms between Western cultures (including those in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand) and East Asian cultures (including those in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, India, and Southeast Asia). Norms in Western cultures are primarily oriented toward <em class="emphasis">individualism</em>, which is about valuing the self and one’s independence from others. Children in Western cultures are taught to develop and to value a sense of their personal self, and to see themselves in large part as separate from the other people around them. Children in Western cultures feel special about themselves; they enjoy getting gold stars on their projects and the best grade in the class. Adults in Western cultures are oriented toward promoting their own individual success, frequently in comparison to (or even at the expense of) others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s07_p04">Norms in the East Asian culture, on the other hand, are oriented toward interdependence or <em class="emphasis">collectivism</em>. In these cultures children are taught to focus on developing harmonious social relationships with others. The predominant norms relate to group togetherness and connectedness, and duty and responsibility to one’s family and other groups. When asked to describe themselves, the members of East Asian cultures are more likely than those from Western cultures to indicate that they are particularly concerned about the interests of others, including their close friends and their colleagues.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s07_p05">Another important cultural difference is the extent to which people in different cultures are bound by social norms and customs, rather than being free to express their own individuality without considering social norms (Chan, Gelfand, Triandis, &amp; Tzeng, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_035">Chan, D. K. S., Gelfand, M. J., Triandis, H. C., &amp; Tzeng, O. (1996). Tightness-looseness revisited: Some preliminary analyses in Japan and the United States. <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Psychology, 31</em>, 1–12.</span> Cultures also differ in terms of personal space, such as how closely individuals stand to each other when talking, as well as the communication styles they employ.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s07_p06">It is important to be aware of cultures and cultural differences because people with different cultural backgrounds increasingly come into contact with each other as a result of increased travel and immigration and the development of the Internet and other forms of communication. In the United States, for instance, there are many different ethnic groups, and the proportion of the population that comes from minority (non-White) groups is increasing from year to year. The social-cultural approach to understanding behavior reminds us again of the difficulty of making broad generalizations about human nature. Different people experience things differently, and they experience them differently in different cultures.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Psychology in Everyday Life: How to Effectively Learn and Remember</h3>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p02">One way that the findings of psychological research may be particularly helpful to you is in terms of improving your learning and study skills. Psychological research has provided a substantial amount of knowledge about the principles of learning and memory. This information can help you do better in this and other courses, and can also help you better learn new concepts and techniques in other areas of your life.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p03">The most important thing you can learn in college is how to better study, learn, and remember. These skills will help you throughout your life, as you learn new jobs and take on other responsibilities. There are substantial individual differences in learning and memory, such that some people learn faster than others. But even if it takes you longer to learn than you think it should, the extra time you put into studying is well worth the effort. And you can learn to learn—learning to effectively study and to remember information is just like learning any other skill, such as playing a sport or a video game.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p04">To learn well, you need to be ready to learn. You cannot learn well when you are tired, when you are under stress, or if you are abusing alcohol or drugs. Try to keep a consistent routine of sleeping and eating. Eat moderately and nutritiously, and avoid drugs that can impair memory, particularly alcohol. There is no evidence that stimulants such as caffeine, amphetamines, or any of the many “memory enhancing drugs” on the market will help you learn (Gold, Cahill, &amp; Wenk, 2002; McDaniel, Maier, &amp; Einstein, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_037">Gold, P. E., Cahill, L., &amp; Wenk, G. L. (2002). Ginkgo biloba: A cognitive enhancer? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 3</em>(1), 2–11; McDaniel, M. A., Maier, S. F., &amp; Einstein, G. O. (2002). “Brain-specific” nutrients: A memory cure? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 3</em>(1), 12–38.</span> Memory supplements are usually no more effective than drinking a can of sugared soda, which also releases glucose and thus improves memory slightly.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p05">Psychologists have studied the ways that best allow people to acquire new information, to retain it over time, and to retrieve information that has been stored in our memories. One important finding is that learning is an active process. To acquire information most effectively, we must actively manipulate it. One active approach is rehearsal—repeating the information that is to be learned over and over again. Although simple repetition does help us learn, psychological research has found that we acquire information most effectively when we actively think about or elaborate on its meaning and relate the material to something else.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p06">When you study, try to elaborate by connecting the information to other things that you already know. If you want to remember the different schools of psychology, for instance, try to think about how each of the approaches is different from the others. As you make the comparisons among the approaches, determine what is most important about each one and then relate it to the features of the other approaches. In an important study showing the effectiveness of elaborative encoding, Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker (1977)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_038">Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 35</em>(9), 677–688.</span> found that students learned information best when they related it to aspects of themselves (a phenomenon known as the <em class="emphasis">self-reference effect</em>). This research suggests that imagining how the material relates to your own interests and goals will help you learn it.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p07">An approach known as the <em class="emphasis">method of loci</em> involves linking each of the pieces of information that you need to remember to places that you are familiar with. You might think about the house that you grew up in and the rooms in it. Then you could put the behaviorists in the bedroom, the structuralists in the living room, and the functionalists in the kitchen. Then when you need to remember the information, you retrieve the mental image of your house and should be able to “see” each of the people in each of the areas.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p08">One of the most fundamental principles of learning is known as the <em class="emphasis">spacing effect</em>. Both humans and animals more easily remember or learn material when they study the material in several shorter study periods over a longer period of time, rather than studying it just once for a long period of time. Cramming for an exam is a particularly ineffective way to learn.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p09">Psychologists have also found that performance is improved when people set difficult yet realistic goals for themselves (Locke &amp; Latham, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn01_039">Locke, E. A., &amp; Latham, G. P. (2006). New directions in goal-setting theory. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 15</em>(5), 265–268</span> You can use this knowledge to help you learn. Set realistic goals for the time you are going to spend studying and what you are going to learn, and try to stick to those goals. Do a small amount every day, and by the end of the week you will have accomplished a lot.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p10">Our ability to adequately assess our own knowledge is known as <em class="emphasis">metacognition</em>. Research suggests that our metacognition may make us overconfident, leading us to believe that we have learned material even when we have not. To counteract this problem, don’t just go over your notes again and again. Instead, make a list of questions and then see if you can answer them. Study the information again and then test yourself again after a few minutes. If you made any mistakes, study again. Then wait for a half hour and test yourself again. Then test again after 1 day and after 2 days. Testing yourself by attempting to retrieve information in an active manner is better than simply studying the material because it will help you determine if you really know it.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch01_s02_s08_p11">In summary, everyone can learn to learn better. Learning is an important skill, and following the previously mentioned guidelines will likely help you learn better.</p>
