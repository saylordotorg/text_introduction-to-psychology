        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_p01">On September 6, 2007, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders’ summit was being held in downtown Sydney, Australia. World leaders, including the then-current U.S. president, George W. Bush, were attending the summit. Many roads in the area were closed for security reasons, and police presence was high.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_p02">As a prank, eight members of the Australian television satire <em class="emphasis">The Chaser’s War on Everything</em> assembled a false motorcade made up of two black four-wheel-drive vehicles, a black sedan, two motorcycles, body guards, and chauffeurs (see the video below). Group member Chas Licciardello was in one of the cars disguised as Osama bin Laden. The motorcade drove through Sydney’s central business district and entered the security zone of the meeting. The motorcade was waved on by police, through two checkpoints, until the Chaser group decided it had taken the gag far enough and stopped outside the InterContinental Hotel where former President Bush was staying. Licciardello stepped out onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. Only at this time did the police belatedly check the identity of the group members, finally arresting them.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_p03">Afterward, the group testified that it had made little effort to disguise its attempt as anything more than a prank. The group’s only realistic attempt to fool police was its Canadian-flag marked vehicles. Other than that, the group used obviously fake credentials, and its security passes were printed with “JOKE,” “Insecurity,” and “It’s pretty obvious this isn’t a real pass,” all clearly visible to any police officer who might have been troubled to look closely as the motorcade passed. The required APEC 2007 Official Vehicle stickers had the name of the group’s show printed on them, and this text: “This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him.” In addition, a few of the “bodyguards” were carrying camcorders, and one of the motorcyclists was dressed in jeans, both details that should have alerted police that something was amiss.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_p04">The Chaser pranksters later explained the primary reason for the stunt. They wanted to make a statement about the fact that bin Laden, a world leader, had not been invited to an APEC Summit where issues of terror were being discussed. The secondary motive was to test the event’s security. The show’s lawyers approved the stunt, under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the APEC meeting.</p>

Sensation and perception work seamlessly together to allow us to experience the world through our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, but also to combine what we are currently learning from the environment with what we already know about it to make judgments and to choose appropriate behaviors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_p06">The study of sensation and perception is exceedingly important for our everyday lives because the knowledge generated by psychologists is used in so many ways to help so many people. Psychologists work closely with mechanical and electrical engineers, with experts in defense and military contractors, and with clinical, health, and sports psychologists to help them apply this knowledge to their everyday practices. The research is used to help us understand and better prepare people to cope with such diverse events as driving cars, flying planes, creating robots, and managing pain (Fajen &amp; Warren, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_002">Fajen, B. R., &amp; Warren, W. H. (2003). Behavioral dynamics of steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 29</em>(2), 343–362.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_p07">We will begin the chapter with a focus on the six senses of <em class="emphasis">seeing</em>, <em class="emphasis">hearing</em>, <em class="emphasis">smelling</em>, <em class="emphasis">touching</em>, <em class="emphasis">tasting</em>, and <em class="emphasis">monitoring the body’s positions (proprioception)</em>. We will see that sensation is sometimes relatively direct, in the sense that the wide variety of stimuli around us inform and guide our behaviors quickly and accurately, but nevertheless is always the result of at least some interpretation. We do not directly experience stimuli, but rather we experience those stimuli as they are created by our senses. Each sense accomplishes the basic process of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transduction</a><span class="glossdef">The conversion of stimuli detected by receptor cells to electrical impulses that are then transported to the brain.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the conversion of stimuli detected by receptor cells to electrical impulses that are then transported to the brain</em>—in different, but related, ways.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_p08">After we have reviewed the basic processes of sensation, we will turn to the topic of perception, focusing on how the brain’s processing of sensory experience can not only help us make quick and accurate judgments, but also mislead us into making perceptual and judgmental errors, such as those that allowed the Chaser group to breach security at the APEC meeting.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Humans possess powerful sensory capacities that allow us to sense the kaleidoscope of sights, sounds, smells, and tastes that surround us. Our eyes detect light energy and our ears pick up sound waves. Our skin senses touch, pressure, hot, and cold. Our tongues react to the molecules of the foods we eat, and our noses detect scents in the air. The human perceptual system is wired for accuracy, and people are exceedingly good at making use of the wide variety of information available to them (Stoffregen &amp; Bardy, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_003">Stoffregen, T.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s01_p02">In many ways our senses are quite remarkable. The human eye can detect the equivalent of a single candle flame burning 30 miles away and can distinguish among more than 300,000 different colors. The human ear can detect sounds as low as 20 <em class="emphasis">hertz</em> (vibrations per second) and as high as 20,000 hertz, and it can hear the tick of a clock about 20 feet away in a quiet room. We can taste a teaspoon of sugar dissolved in 2 gallons of water, and we are able to smell one drop of perfume diffused in a three-room apartment. We can feel the wing of a bee on our cheek dropped from 1 centimeter above (Galanter, 1962).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_004">Galanter, E.

Dogs, bats, whales, and some rodents all have much better hearing than we do, and many animals have a far richer sense of smell. Birds are able to see the ultraviolet light that we cannot (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s01_s01_f02">Figure 4.3 "Ultraviolet Light and Bird Vision"</a>) and can also sense the pull of the earth’s magnetic field. Cats have an extremely sensitive and sophisticated sense of touch, and they are able to navigate in complete darkness using their whiskers. The fact that different organisms have different sensations is part of their evolutionary adaptation. Each species is adapted to sensing the things that are most important to them, while being blissfully unaware of the things that don’t matter.</p>

The field of psychophysics was founded by the German psychologist Gustav Fechner (1801–1887), who was the first to study the relationship between the strength of a stimulus and a person’s ability to detect the stimulus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p02">The measurement techniques developed by Fechner and his colleagues are designed in part to help determine the limits of human sensation. One important criterion is the ability to detect very faint stimuli. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">absolute threshold</a><span class="glossdef">The intensity of a stimulus that allows an organism to just barely detect it.</span></span> of a sensation is defined as <em class="emphasis">the intensity of a stimulus that allows an organism to just barely detect it</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p03">In a typical psychophysics experiment, an individual is presented with a series of trials in which a signal is sometimes presented and sometimes not, or in which two stimuli are presented that are either the same or different. Imagine, for instance, that you were asked to take a hearing test. On each of the trials your task is to indicate either “yes” if you heard a sound or “no” if you did not. The signals are purposefully made to be very faint, making accurate judgments difficult.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p04">The problem for you is that the very faint signals create uncertainty. Because our ears are constantly sending background information to the brain, you will sometimes think that you heard a sound when none was there, and you will sometimes fail to detect a sound that is there. Your task is to determine whether the neural activity that you are experiencing is due to the background noise alone or is a result of a signal within the noise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p05">The responses that you give on the hearing test can be analyzed using <em class="emphasis">signal detection analysis</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Signal detection analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A technique used to determine the ability of the perceiver to separate true signals from background noise.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">a technique used to determine the ability of the perceiver to separate true signals from background noise</em> (Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005; Wickens, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_005">Macmillan, N.

New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s01_s02_f01">Figure 4.4 "Outcomes of a Signal Detection Analysis"</a>, each judgment trial creates four possible outcomes: A <em class="emphasis">hit</em> occurs when you, as the listener, correctly say “yes” when there was a sound. A <em class="emphasis">false alarm</em> occurs when you respond “yes” to no signal. In the other two cases you respond “no”—either a <em class="emphasis">miss</em> (saying “no” when there was a signal) or a <em class="emphasis">correct rejection</em> (saying “no” when there was in fact no signal).</p>

            <p class="para">Our ability to accurately detect stimuli is measured using a signal detection analysis. Two of the possible decisions (hits and correct rejections) are accurate; the other two (misses and false alarms) are errors.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p06">The analysis of the data from a psychophysics experiment creates two measures. One measure, known as <em class="emphasis">sensitivity</em>, refers to the true ability of the individual to detect the presence or absence of signals. People who have better hearing will have higher sensitivity than will those with poorer hearing. The other measure, <em class="emphasis">response bias</em>, refers to a behavioral tendency to respond “yes” to the trials, which is independent of sensitivity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p07">Imagine for instance that rather than taking a hearing test, you are a soldier on guard duty, and your job is to detect the very faint sound of the breaking of a branch that indicates that an enemy is nearby. You can see that in this case making a false alarm by alerting the other soldiers to the sound might not be as costly as a miss (a failure to report the sound), which could be deadly. Therefore, you might well adopt a very lenient response bias in which whenever you are at all unsure, you send a warning signal. In this case your responses may not be very accurate (your sensitivity may be low because you are making a lot of false alarms) and yet the extreme response bias can save lives.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p08">Another application of signal detection occurs when medical technicians study body images for the presence of cancerous tumors. Again, a miss (in which the technician incorrectly determines that there is no tumor) can be very costly, but false alarms (referring patients who do not have tumors to further testing) also have costs. The ultimate decisions that the technicians make are based on the quality of the signal (clarity of the image), their experience and training (the ability to recognize certain shapes and textures of tumors), and their best guesses about the relative costs of misses versus false alarms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p09">Although we have focused to this point on the absolute threshold, a second important criterion concerns the ability to assess differences between stimuli. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">difference threshold (or just noticeable difference [JND])</a><span class="glossdef">The change in a stimulus that can just barely be detected by the organism.</span></span>, refers to <em class="emphasis">the change in a stimulus that can just barely be detected by the organism.</em> The German physiologist Ernst Weber (1795–1878) made an important discovery about the JND—namely, that the ability to detect differences depends not so much on the size of the difference but on the size of the difference in relationship to the absolute size of the stimulus. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Weber’s law</a><span class="glossdef">Just noticeable difference of a stimulus is a constant proportion of the original intensity of the stimulus.</span></span> maintains that the <em class="emphasis">just noticeable difference of a stimulus is a constant proportion of the original intensity of the stimulus</em>. As an example, if you have a cup of coffee that has only a very little bit of sugar in it (say 1 teaspoon), adding another teaspoon of sugar will make a big difference in taste. But if you added that same teaspoon to a cup of coffee that already had 5 teaspoons of sugar in it, then you probably wouldn’t taste the difference as much (in fact, according to Weber’s law, you would have to add 5 more teaspoons to make the same difference in taste).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p10">One interesting application of Weber’s law is in our everyday shopping behavior. Our tendency to perceive cost differences between products is dependent not only on the amount of money we will spend or save, but also on the amount of money saved relative to the price of the purchase. I would venture to say that if you were about to buy a soda or candy bar in a convenience store and the price of the items ranged from $1 to $3, you would think that the $3 item cost “a lot more” than the $1 item. But now imagine that you were comparing between two music systems, one that cost $397 and one that cost $399. Probably you would think that the cost of the two systems was “about the same,” even though buying the cheaper one would still save you $2.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p12">A variety of research programs have found that subliminal stimuli can influence our judgments and behavior, at least in the short term (Dijksterhuis, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_006">Dijksterhuis, A.

Beyond Vicary’s fantasies: The impact of subliminal priming and brand choice. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 42</em>(6), 792–798.</span> had Dutch college students view a series of computer trials in which a string of letters such as <em class="emphasis">BBBBBBBBB</em> or <em class="emphasis">BBBbBBBBB</em> were presented on the screen. To be sure they paid attention to the display, the students were asked to note whether the strings contained a small <em class="emphasis">b</em>. However, immediately before each of the letter strings, the researchers presented either the name of a drink that is popular in Holland (Lipton Ice) or a control string containing the same letters as Lipton Ice (NpeicTol). These words were presented so quickly (for only about one fiftieth of a second) that the participants could not see them.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p13">Then the students were asked to indicate their intention to drink Lipton Ice by answering questions such as “If you would sit on a terrace now, how likely is it that you would order Lipton Ice,” and also to indicate how thirsty they were at the time. The researchers found that the students who had been exposed to the “Lipton Ice” words (and particularly those who indicated that they were already thirsty) were significantly more likely to say that they would drink Lipton Ice than were those who had been exposed to the control words.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p14">If it were effective, procedures such as this (we can call the technique “subliminal advertising” because it advertises a product outside awareness) would have some major advantages for advertisers, because it would allow them to promote their products without directly interrupting the consumers’ activity and without the consumers’ knowing they are being persuaded. People cannot counterargue with, or attempt to avoid being influenced by, messages received outside awareness. Due to fears that people may be influenced without their knowing, subliminal advertising has been legally banned in many countries, including Australia, Great Britain, and the United States.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p15">Although it has been proven to work in some research, subliminal advertising’s effectiveness is still uncertain. Charles Trappey (1996)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_008">Trappey, C. (1996). A meta-analysis of consumer choice and subliminal advertising. <em class="emphasis">Psychology and Marketing, 13</em>, 517–530.</span> conducted a meta-analysis in which he combined 23 leading research studies that had tested the influence of subliminal advertising on consumer choice. The results of his meta-analysis showed that subliminal advertising had a negligible effect on consumer choice. And Saegert (1987, p. 107)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_009">Saegert, J. (1987). Why marketing should quit giving subliminal advertising the benefit of the doubt. <em class="emphasis">Psychology and Marketing, 4</em>(2), 107–120.</span> concluded that “marketing should quit giving subliminal advertising the benefit of the doubt,” arguing that the influences of subliminal stimuli are usually so weak that they are normally overshadowed by the person’s own decision making about the behavior.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_p16">Taken together then, the evidence for the effectiveness of subliminal advertising is weak, and its effects may be limited to only some people and in only some conditions. You probably don’t have to worry too much about being subliminally persuaded in your everyday life, even if subliminal ads are allowed in your country. But even if subliminal advertising is not all that effective itself, there are plenty of other indirect advertising techniques that are used and that do work. For instance, many ads for automobiles and alcoholic beverages are subtly sexualized, which encourages the consumer to indirectly (even if not subliminally) associate these products with sexuality. And there is the ever more frequent “product placement” techniques, where images of brands (cars, sodas, electronics, and so forth) are placed on websites and in popular television shows and movies. Harris, Bargh, &amp; Brownell (2009)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_010">Harris, J. L., Bargh, J. A., &amp; Brownell, K. D. (2009). Priming effects of television food advertising on eating behavior. <em class="emphasis">Health Psychology, 28(4)</em>, 404–413.</span> found that being exposed to food advertising on television significantly increased child and adult snacking behaviors, again suggesting that the effects of perceived images, even if presented above the absolute threshold, may nevertheless be very subtle.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="stangor-ch04_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Sensation is the process of receiving information from the environment through our sensory organs. Perception is the process of interpreting and organizing the incoming information in order that we can understand it and react accordingly.</li>
                <li>Transduction is the conversion of stimuli detected by receptor cells to electrical impulses that are transported to the brain.</li>
                <li>Although our experiences of the world are rich and complex, humans—like all species—have their own adapted sensory strengths and sensory limitations.</li>
                <li>Sensation and perception work together in a fluid, continuous process.</li>
                <li>Our judgments in detection tasks are influenced by both the absolute threshold of the signal as well as our current motivations and experiences. Signal detection analysis is used to differentiate sensitivity from response biases.</li>
                <li>The difference threshold, or just noticeable difference, is the ability to detect the smallest change in a stimulus about 50% of the time. According to Weber’s law, the just noticeable difference increases in proportion to the total intensity of the stimulus.</li>
                <li>Research has found that stimuli can influence behavior even when they are presented below the absolute threshold (i.e., subliminally). The effectiveness of subliminal advertising, however, has not been shown to be of large magnitude.</li>

Although the principle of contralateral control might lead you to expect that the left eye would send information to the right brain hemisphere and vice versa, nature is smarter than that. In fact, the left and right eyes each send information to both the left and the right hemisphere, and the visual cortex processes each of the cues separately and in parallel.

One type of cone reacts primarily to blue light (short wavelengths), another reacts primarily to green light (medium wavelengths), and a third reacts primarily to red light (long wavelengths). The visual cortex then detects and compares the strength of the signals from each of the three types of cones, creating the experience of color. According to this <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Young-Helmholtz trichromatic color theory</a><span class="glossdef">The theory of color perception that proposes that what color we see depends on the mix of the signals from the three types of cones.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">what color we see depends on the mix of the signals from the three types of cones</em>. If the brain is receiving primarily red and blue signals, for instance, it will perceive purple; if it is receiving primarily red and green signals it will perceive yellow; and if it is receiving messages from all three types of cones it will perceive white.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s02_s02_p04">The trichromatic color theory cannot explain all of human vision, however. For one, although the color purple does appear to us as a mixing of red and blue, yellow does not appear to be a mix of red and green. And people with color blindness, who cannot see either green or red, nevertheless can still see yellow. An alternative approach to the Young-Helmholtz theory, known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">opponent-process color theory</a><span class="glossdef">The theory of color perception that proposes that we analyze sensory information in three sets of “opponent colors”: red-green, yellow-blue, and white-black.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">proposes that we analyze sensory information not in terms of three colors but rather in three sets of “opponent colors”: red-green, yellow-blue, and white-black.</em> Evidence for the opponent-process theory comes from the fact that some neurons in the retina and in the visual cortex are excited by one color (e.g., red) but inhibited by another color (e.g., green).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s02_s02_p05">One example of opponent processing occurs in the experience of an afterimage. If you stare at the flag on the left side of <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s02_s02_f03">Figure 4.16 "U.S. Flag"</a> for about 30 seconds (the longer you look, the better the effect), and then move your eyes to the blank area to the right of it, you will see the afterimage. When we stare at the green stripes, our green receptors habituate and begin to process less strongly, whereas the red receptors remain at full strength. When we switch our gaze, we see primarily the red part of the opponent process. Similar processes create blue after yellow and white after black.</p>

When light rays enter the eye, the red, blue, and green cones on the retina respond in different degrees, and send different strength signals of red, blue, and green through the optic nerve. The color signals are then processed both by the ganglion cells and by the neurons in the visual cortex (Gegenfurtner &amp; Kiper, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_018">Gegenfurtner, K.

The visual cortex automatically merges the two images into one, enabling us to perceive depth. Three-dimensional movies make use of retinal disparity by using 3-D glasses that the viewer wears to create a different image on each eye. The perceptual system quickly, easily, and unconsciously turns the disparity into 3-D.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s02_s04_p04">An important binocular depth cue is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">convergence</a><span class="glossdef">The inward turning of our eyes that is required to focus on objects that are less than about 50 feet away from us.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the inward turning of our eyes that is required to focus on objects that are less than about 50 feet away from us</em>. The visual cortex uses the size of the convergence angle between the eyes to judge the object’s distance. You will be able to feel your eyes converging if you slowly bring a finger closer to your nose while continuing to focus on it. When you close one eye, you no longer feel the tension—convergence is a binocular depth cue that requires both eyes to work.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s02_s05_p01">Many animals, including human beings, have very sophisticated perceptual skills that allow them to coordinate their own motion with the motion of moving objects in order to create a collision with that object. Bats and birds use this mechanism to catch up with prey, dogs use it to catch a Frisbee, and humans use it to catch a moving football. The brain detects motion partly from the changing size of an image on the retina (objects that look bigger are usually closer to us) and in part from the relative brightness of objects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s02_s05_p02">We also experience motion when objects near each other change their appearance. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">beta effect</a><span class="glossdef">The perception of motion that occurs when different images are presented next to each other in succession.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the perception of motion that occurs when different images are presented next to each other in succession</em> (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s02_s05_n01">Note 4.43 "Beta Effect and Phi Phenomenon"</a>). The visual cortex fills in the missing part of the motion and we see the object moving. The beta effect is used in movies to create the experience of motion. A related effect is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">phi phenomenon</a><span class="glossdef">The perception of motion caused by the appearance and disappearance of objects that are near each other.</span></span>, in which <em class="emphasis">we perceive a sensation of motion caused by the appearance and disappearance of objects that are near each other</em>. The phi phenomenon looks like a moving zone or cloud of background color surrounding the flashing objects. The beta effect and the phi phenomenon are other examples of the importance of the gestalt—our tendency to “see more than the sum of the parts.”</p>

                <li>Light enters the eye through the transparent cornea and passes through the pupil at the center of the iris. The lens adjusts to focus the light on the retina, where it appears upside down and backward. Receptor cells on the retina are excited or inhibited by the light and send information to the visual cortex through the optic nerve.</li>
                <li>The retina has two types of photoreceptor cells: rods, which detect brightness and respond to black and white, and cones, which respond to red, green, and blue. Color blindness occurs when people lack function in the red- or green-sensitive cones.</li>
                <li>Feature detector neurons in the visual cortex help us recognize objects, and some neurons respond selectively to faces and other body parts.</li>
                <li>The Young-Helmholtz trichromatic color theory proposes that color perception is the result of the signals sent by the three types of cones, whereas the opponent-process color theory proposes that we perceive color as three sets of opponent colors: red-green, yellow-blue, and white-black.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_p01">Like vision and all the other senses, hearing begins with transduction. Sound waves that are collected by our ears are converted into neural impulses, which are sent to the brain where they are integrated with past experience and interpreted as the sounds we experience. The human ear is sensitive to a wide range of sounds, ranging from the faint tick of a clock in a nearby room to the roar of a rock band at a nightclub, and we have the ability to detect very small variations in sound. But the ear is particularly sensitive to sounds in the same frequency as the human voice. A mother can pick out her child’s voice from a host of others, and when we pick up the phone we quickly recognize a familiar voice. In a fraction of a second, our auditory system receives the sound waves, transmits them to the auditory cortex, compares them to stored knowledge of other voices, and identifies the identity of the caller.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Ear</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s01_p01">Just as the eye detects light waves, the ear detects sound waves. Vibrating objects (such as the human vocal chords or guitar strings) cause air molecules to bump into each other and produce sound waves, which travel from their source as peaks and valleys much like the ripples that expand outward when a stone is tossed into a pond. Unlike light waves, which can travel in a vacuum, sound waves are carried within mediums such as air, water, or metal, and it is the changes in pressure associated with these mediums that the ear detects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s01_p02">As with light waves, we detect both the wavelength and the <em class="emphasis">amplitude</em> of sound waves. The <em class="emphasis">wavelength of the sound wave</em> (known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency</a><span class="glossdef">The wavelength of a sound wave.</span></span>) is measured in terms of the number of waves that arrive per second and determines our perception of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pitch</a><span class="glossdef">The perceived frequency of a sound.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the perceived frequency of a sound.</em> Longer sound waves have lower frequency and produce a lower pitch, whereas shorter waves have higher frequency and a higher pitch.</p>

Larger waves are perceived as louder. Loudness is measured using <em class="emphasis">the unit of relative loudness</em> known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decibel</a><span class="glossdef">The unit of relative loudness.</span></span>. Zero decibels represent the absolute threshold for human hearing, below which we cannot hear a sound. Each increase in 10 decibels represents a tenfold increase in the loudness of the sound (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 4.29 "Sounds in Everyday Life"</a>). The sound of a typical conversation (about 60 decibels) is 1,000 times louder than the sound of a faint whisper (30 decibels), whereas the sound of a jackhammer (130 decibels) is 10 billion times louder than the whisper.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s01_p05">The movements of the fluid in the cochlea bend the hair cells of the inner ear, much in the same way that a gust of wind bends over wheat stalks in a field. The movements of the hair cells trigger nerve impulses in the attached neurons, which are sent to the auditory nerve and then to the auditory cortex in the brain. The cochlea contains about 16,000 hair cells, each of which holds a bundle of fibers known as <em class="emphasis">cilia</em> on its tip. The cilia are so sensitive that they can detect a movement that pushes them the width of a single atom. To put things in perspective, cilia swaying at the width of an atom is equivalent to the tip of the Eiffel Tower swaying by half an inch (Corey et al., 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_025">Corey, D.

            <p class="para">Sound waves enter the outer ear and are transmitted through the auditory canal to the eardrum. The resulting vibrations are moved by the three small ossicles into the cochlea, where they are detected by hair cells and sent to the auditory nerve.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s01_p06">Although loudness is directly determined by the number of hair cells that are vibrating, two different mechanisms are used to detect pitch. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency theory of hearing</a><span class="glossdef">A theory of pitch perception that proposes that nerve impulses corresponding to the pitch of a sound are sent to the auditory nerve.</span></span> proposes that <em class="emphasis">whatever the pitch of a sound wave, nerve impulses of a corresponding frequency will be sent to the auditory nerve</em>. For example, a tone measuring 600 hertz will be transduced into 600 nerve impulses a second. This theory has a problem with high-pitched sounds, however, because the neurons cannot fire fast enough. To reach the necessary speed, the neurons work together in a sort of volley system in which different neurons fire in sequence, allowing us to detect sounds up to about 4,000 hertz.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s01_p07">Not only is frequency important, but location is critical as well. The cochlea relays information about the specific area, or place, in the cochlea that is most activated by the incoming sound. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">place theory of hearing</a><span class="glossdef">A theory of pitch perception that proposes that different areas of the cochlea respond to different sound frequencies.</span></span> proposes that <em class="emphasis">different areas of the cochlea respond to different frequencies</em>. Higher tones excite areas closest to the opening of the cochlea (near the oval window). Lower tones excite areas near the narrow tip of the cochlea, at the opposite end. Pitch is therefore determined in part by the area of the cochlea firing the most frequently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s01_p08">Just as having two eyes in slightly different positions allows us to perceive depth, so the fact that the ears are placed on either side of the head enables us to benefit from stereophonic, or three-dimensional, hearing. If a sound occurs on your left side, the left ear will receive the sound slightly sooner than the right ear, and the sound it receives will be more intense, allowing you to quickly determine the location of the sound. Although the distance between our two ears is only about 6 inches, and sound waves travel at 750 miles an hour, the time and intensity differences are easily detected (Middlebrooks &amp; Green, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_026">Middlebrooks, J. C., &amp; Green, D. M. (1991). Sound localization by human listeners. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Psychology, 42,</em> 135–159.</span> When a sound is equidistant from both ears, such as when it is directly in front, behind, beneath or overhead, we have more difficulty pinpointing its location. It is for this reason that dogs (and people, too) tend to cock their heads when trying to pinpoint a sound, so that the ears receive slightly different signals.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Hearing Loss</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s02_p01">More than 31 million Americans suffer from some kind of hearing impairment (Kochkin, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_027">Kochkin, S.

MarkeTrak VII: Hearing loss population tops 31 million people. <em class="emphasis">Hearing Review, 12</em>(7) 16–29.</span> <em class="emphasis">Conductive hearing loss</em> is caused by physical damage to the ear (such as to the eardrums or ossicles) that reduce the ability of the ear to transfer vibrations from the outer ear to the inner ear. <em class="emphasis">Sensorineural hearing loss</em>, which is caused by damage to the cilia or to the auditory nerve, is less common overall but frequently occurs with age (Tennesen, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_028">Tennesen, M. (2007, March 10). Gone today, hear tomorrow. <em class="emphasis">New Scientist, 2594</em>, 42–45.</span> The cilia are extremely fragile, and by the time we are 65 years old, we will have lost 40% of them, particularly those that respond to high-pitched sounds (Chisolm, Willott, &amp; Lister, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_029">Chisolm, T.

The aging auditory system: Anatomic and physiologic changes and implications for rehabilitation. <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Audiology, 42</em>(Suppl. 2), 2S3–2S10.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s02_p02">Prolonged exposure to loud sounds will eventually create sensorineural hearing loss as the cilia are damaged by the noise. People who constantly operate noisy machinery without using appropriate ear protection are at high risk of hearing loss, as are people who listen to loud music on their headphones or who engage in noisy hobbies, such as hunting or motorcycling. Sounds that are 85 decibels or more can cause damage to your hearing, particularly if you are exposed to them repeatedly. Sounds of more than 130 decibels are dangerous even if you are exposed to them infrequently. People who experience <em class="emphasis">tinnitus</em> (a ringing or a buzzing sensation) after being exposed to loud sounds have very likely experienced some damage to their cilia. Taking precautions when being exposed to loud sound is important, as cilia do not grow back.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s03_s02_p03">While conductive hearing loss can often be improved through hearing aids that amplify the sound, they are of little help to sensorineural hearing loss. But if the auditory nerve is still intact, a <em class="emphasis">cochlear implant</em> may be used. A cochlear implant is a device made up of a series of electrodes that are placed inside the cochlea. The device serves to bypass the hair cells by stimulating the auditory nerve cells directly. The latest implants utilize place theory, enabling different spots on the implant to respond to different levels of pitch. The cochlear implant can help children hear who would normally be deaf, and if the device is implanted early enough, these children can frequently learn to speak, often as well as normal children do (Dettman, Pinder, Briggs, Dowell, &amp; Leigh, 2007; Dorman &amp; Wilson, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_030">Dettman, S.

The vibrations are detected by the cilia (hair cells) and sent via the auditory nerve to the auditory cortex.</li>
                <li>There are two theories as to how we perceive pitch: The frequency theory of hearing suggests that as a sound wave’s pitch changes, nerve impulses of a corresponding frequency enter the auditory nerve. The place theory of hearing suggests that we hear different pitches because different areas of the cochlea respond to higher and lower pitches.</li>
                <li>Conductive hearing loss is caused by physical damage to the ear or eardrum and may be improved by hearing aids or cochlear implants. Sensorineural hearing loss, caused by damage to the hair cells or auditory nerves in the inner ear, may be produced by prolonged exposure to sounds of more than 85 decibels.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_p01">Although vision and hearing are by far the most important, human sensation is rounded out by four other senses, each of which provides an essential avenue to a better understanding of and response to the world around us. These other senses are <em class="emphasis">touch</em>, <em class="emphasis">taste</em>, <em class="emphasis">smell</em>, and our <em class="emphasis">sense of body position and movement (proprioception)</em>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Tasting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s01_p01">Taste is important not only because it allows us to enjoy the food we eat, but even more crucial, because it leads us toward foods that provide energy (sugar, for instance) and away from foods that could be harmful. Many children are picky eaters for a reason—they are biologically predisposed to be very careful about what they eat. Together with the sense of smell, taste helps us maintain appetite, assess potential dangers (such as the odor of a gas leak or a burning house), and avoid eating poisonous or spoiled food.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s01_p02">Our ability to taste begins at the taste receptors on the tongue. The tongue detects six different taste sensations, known respectively as <em class="emphasis">sweet, salty, sour, bitter, piquancy (spicy)</em>, and <em class="emphasis">umami (savory)</em>. Umami is a meaty taste associated with meats, cheeses, soy, seaweed, and mushrooms, and particularly found in monosodium glutamate (MSG), a popular flavor enhancer (Ikeda, 1909/2002; Sugimoto &amp; Ninomiya, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_031">Ikeda, K. (2002). [New seasonings]. <em class="emphasis">Chemical Senses, 27</em>(9), 847–849. Translated and shortened to 75% by Y. Ogiwara &amp; Y. Ninomiya from the <em class="emphasis">Journal of the Chemical Society of Tokyo, 30</em>, 820–836. (Original work published 1909); Sugimoto, K., &amp; Ninomiya, Y. (2005). Introductory remarks on umami research: Candidate receptors and signal transduction mechanisms on umami. <em class="emphasis">Chemical Senses, 30</em>(Suppl. 1), Pi21–i22.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s01_p03">Our tongues are covered with <em class="emphasis">taste buds</em>, which are designed to sense chemicals in the mouth. Most taste buds are located in the top outer edges of the tongue, but there are also receptors at the back of the tongue as well as on the walls of the mouth and at the back of the throat. As we chew food, it dissolves and enters the taste buds, triggering nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain (Northcutt, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_032">Northcutt, R. G. (2004). Taste buds: Development and evolution. <em class="emphasis">Brain, Behavior and Evolution, 64</em>(3), 198–206.</span> Human tongues are covered with 2,000 to 10,000 taste buds, and each bud contains between 50 and 100 taste receptor cells. Taste buds are activated very quickly; a salty or sweet taste that touches a taste bud for even one tenth of a second will trigger a neural impulse (Kelling &amp; Halpern, 1983).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_033">Kelling, S. T., &amp; Halpern, B. P. (1983). Taste flashes: Reaction times, intensity, and quality. <em class="emphasis">Science, 219</em>, 412–414.</span> On average, taste buds live for about 5 days, after which new taste buds are created to replace them. As we get older, however, the rate of creation decreases making us less sensitive to taste. This change helps explain why some foods that seem so unpleasant in childhood are more enjoyable in adulthood.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s01_p04">The area of the sensory cortex that responds to taste is in a very similar location to the area that responds to smell, a fact that helps explain why the sense of smell also contributes to our experience of the things we eat. You may remember having had difficulty tasting food when you had a bad cold, and if you block your nose and taste slices of raw potato, apple, and parsnip, you will not be able to taste the differences between them. Our experience of texture in a food (the way we feel it on our tongues) also influences how we taste it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Smelling</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s02_p01">As we breathe in air through our nostrils, we inhale airborne chemical molecules, which are detected by the 10 million to 20 million receptor cells embedded in the <em class="emphasis">olfactory membrane</em> of the upper nasal passage. The <em class="emphasis">olfactory receptor cells</em> are topped with tentacle-like protrusions that contain receptor proteins. When an odor receptor is stimulated, the membrane sends neural messages up the olfactory nerve to the brain (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s04_s02_f01">Figure 4.31 "Smell Receptors"</a>).</p>

Like a lock and key, different chemical molecules “fit” into different receptor cells, and odors are detected according to their influence on a combination of receptor cells. Just as the 10 digits from <em class="emphasis">0</em> to <em class="emphasis">9</em> can combine in many different ways to produce an endless array of phone numbers, odor molecules bind to different combinations of receptors, and these combinations are decoded in the olfactory cortex. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s04_s02_f02">Figure 4.32 "Age Differences in Smell"</a>, women tend to have a more acute sense of smell than men. The sense of smell peaks in early adulthood and then begins a slow decline. By ages 60 to 70, the sense of smell has become sharply diminished.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s03_p02">The skin, the largest organ in the body, is the sensory organ for touch. The skin contains a variety of nerve endings, combinations of which respond to particular types of pressures and temperatures. When you touch different parts of the body, you will find that some areas are more ticklish, whereas other areas respond more to pain, cold, or heat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s03_p03">The thousands of nerve endings in the skin respond to four basic sensations: <em class="emphasis">Pressure, hot, cold</em>, and <em class="emphasis">pain</em>, but only the sensation of pressure has its own specialized receptors. Other sensations are created by a combination of the other four. For instance:</p>

            <li>The experience of a tickle is caused by the stimulation of neighboring pressure receptors.</li>

            <li>The experience of itching is caused by repeated stimulation of pain receptors.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s04_s04_p01">We do not enjoy it, but the experience of pain is how the body informs us that we are in danger. The burn when we touch a hot radiator and the sharp stab when we step on a nail lead us to change our behavior, preventing further damage to our bodies.

When we look out the window at a view of the countryside, or when we look at the face of a good friend, we don’t just see a jumble of colors and shapes—we see, instead, an image of a countryside or an image of a friend (Goodale &amp; Milner, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_043">Goodale, M., &amp; Milner, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p05">Selective attention also allows us to focus on a single talker at a party while ignoring other conversations that are occurring around us (Broadbent, 1958; Cherry, 1953).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_047">Broadbent, D.

But selective attention is not complete; we also at the same time monitor what’s happening in the channels we are not focusing on. Perhaps you have had the experience of being at a party and talking to someone in one part of the room, when suddenly you hear your name being mentioned by someone in another part of the room. This <em class="emphasis">cocktail party phenomenon</em> shows us that although selective attention is limiting what we processes, we are nevertheless at the same time doing a lot of unconscious monitoring of the world around us—you didn’t know you were attending to the background sounds of the party, but evidently you were.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p06">A second fundamental process of perception is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sensory adaptation</a><span class="glossdef">A decreased sensitivity to a stimulus after prolonged and constant exposure.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a decreased sensitivity to a stimulus after prolonged and constant exposure</em>. When you step into a swimming pool, the water initially feels cold, but after a while you stop noticing it. After prolonged exposure to the same stimulus, our sensitivity toward it diminishes and we no longer perceive it. The ability to adapt to the things that don’t change around us is essential to our survival, as it leaves our sensory receptors free to detect the important and informative changes in our environment and to respond accordingly. We ignore the sounds that our car makes every day, which leaves us free to pay attention to the sounds that are different from normal, and thus likely to need our attention. Our sensory receptors are alert to novelty and are fatigued after constant exposure to the same stimulus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p07">If sensory adaptation occurs with all senses, why doesn’t an image fade away after we stare at it for a period of time? The answer is that, although we are not aware of it, our eyes are constantly flitting from one angle to the next, making thousands of tiny movements (called <em class="emphasis">saccades</em>) every minute. This constant eye movement guarantees that the image we are viewing always falls on fresh receptor cells. What would happen if we could stop the movement of our eyes? Psychologists have devised a way of testing the sensory adaptation of the eye by attaching an instrument that ensures a constant image is maintained on the eye’s inner surface. Participants are fitted with a contact lens that has miniature slide projector attached to it. Because the projector follows the exact movements of the eye, the same image is always projected, stimulating the same spot, on the retina. Within a few seconds, interesting things begin to happen. The image will begin to vanish, then reappear, only to disappear again, either in pieces or as a whole. Even the eye experiences sensory adaptation (Yarbus, 1967).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_048">Yarbus, A. L. (1967). <em class="emphasis">Eye movements and vision</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p08">One of the major problems in perception is to ensure that we always perceive the same object in the same way, despite the fact that the sensations that it creates on our receptors changes dramatically. <em class="emphasis">The ability to perceive a stimulus as constant despite changes in sensation</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perceptual constancy</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to perceive a stimulus as constant despite changes in sensation.</span></span>. Consider our image of a door as it swings. When it is closed, we see it as rectangular, but when it is open, we see only its edge and it appears as a line. But we never perceive the door as changing shape as it swings—perceptual mechanisms take care of the problem for us by allowing us to see a constant shape.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s05_s01_p09">The visual system also corrects for color constancy. Imagine that you are wearing blue jeans and a bright white t-shirt. When you are outdoors, both colors will be at their brightest, but you will still perceive the white t-shirt as bright and the blue jeans as darker. When you go indoors, the light shining on the clothes will be significantly dimmer, but you will still perceive the t-shirt as bright. This is because we put colors in context and see that, compared to its surroundings, the white t-shirt reflects the most light (McCann, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_049">McCann, J.

The monocular depth cues of position and aerial perspective (see <a class="xref" href="#stangor-ch04_s05_s02_f03">Figure 4.36 "The Moon Illusion"</a>) create the illusion that things that are lower and more hazy are farther away.

Displays that are easy to see in darker conditions quickly become unreadable when the sun shines directly on them. It takes the pilot a relatively long time to adapt to the suddenly much brighter display. Furthermore, perceptual contrast is important. The display cannot be so bright at night that the pilot is unable to see targets in the sky or on the land. Human factors psychologists used these principles to determine the appropriate stimulus intensity needed on these displays so that pilots would be able to read them accurately and quickly under a wide range of conditions. The psychologists accomplished this by developing an automatic control mechanism that senses the ambient light visible through the front cockpit windows and that detects the light falling on the display surface, and then automatically adjusts the intensity of the display for the pilot (Silverstein, Krantz, Gomer, Yeh, &amp; Monty, 1990; Silverstein &amp; Merrifield, 1985).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-stangor-fn04_066">Silverstein, L.

                <li>Sensory interaction occurs when different senses work together, for instance, when taste, smell, and touch together produce the flavor of food.</li>
                <li>Selective attention allows us to focus on some sensory experiences while tuning out others.</li>
                <li>Sensory adaptation occurs when we become less sensitive to some aspects of our environment, freeing us to focus on more important changes.</li>
                <li>Perceptual constancy allows us to perceive an object as the same, despite changes in sensation.</li>
                <li>Cognitive illusions are examples of how our expectations can influence our perceptions.</li>
                <li>Our emotions, motivations, desires, and even our culture can influence our perceptions.</li>

<span class="title-prefix">4.6</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p01">Sensation and perception work seamlessly together to allow us to detect both the presence of, and changes in, the stimuli around us.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p02">The study of sensation and perception is exceedingly important for our everyday lives because the knowledge generated by psychologists is used in so many ways to help so many people.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p03">Each sense accomplishes the basic process of transduction—the conversion of stimuli detected by receptor cells into electrical impulses that are then transported to the brain—in different, but related, ways.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p04">Psychophysics is the branch of psychology that studies the effects of physical stimuli on sensory perceptions. Psychophysicists study the absolute threshold of sensation as well as the difference threshold, or just noticeable difference (JND). Weber’s law maintains that the JND of a stimulus is a constant proportion of the original intensity of the stimulus.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p05">Most of our cerebral cortex is devoted to seeing, and we have substantial visual skills. The eye is a specialized system that includes the cornea, pupil, iris, lens, and retina. Neurons, including rods and cones, react to light landing on the retina and send it to the visual cortex via the optic nerve.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p06">Images are perceived, in part, through the action of feature detector neurons.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p07">The shade of a color, known as hue, is conveyed by the wavelength of the light that enters the eye. The Young-Helmholtz trichromatic color theory and the opponent-process color theory are theories of how the brain perceives color.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p08">Depth is perceived using both binocular and monocular depth cues. Monocular depth cues are based on gestalt principles. The beta effect and the phi phenomenon are important in detecting motion.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p09">The ear detects both the amplitude (loudness) and frequency (pitch) of sound waves.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p10">Important structures of the ear include the pinna, eardrum, ossicles, cochlea, and the oval window.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p11">The frequency theory of hearing proposes that as the pitch of a sound wave increases, nerve impulses of a corresponding frequency are sent to the auditory nerve. The place theory of hearing proposes that different areas of the cochlea respond to different frequencies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p12">Sounds that are 85 decibels or more can cause damage to your hearing, particularly if you are exposed to them repeatedly. Sounds that exceed 130 decibels are dangerous, even if you are exposed to them infrequently.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p13">The tongue detects six different taste sensations, known respectively as sweet, salty, sour, bitter, piquancy (spicy), and umami (savory).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p14">We have approximately 1,000 types of odor receptor cells and it is estimated that we can detect 10,000 different odors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p15">Thousands of nerve endings in the skin respond to four basic sensations: Pressure, hot, cold, and pain, but only the sensation of pressure has its own specialized receptors. The ability to keep track of where the body is moving is provided by the vestibular system.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p16">Perception involves the processes of sensory interaction, selective attention, sensory adaptation, and perceptual constancy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangor-ch04_s06_p17">Although our perception is very accurate, it is not perfect. Our expectations and emotions color our perceptions and may result in illusions.</p>
